\section{Validation of SBML documents}
\label{apdx-validation}

An important concern is being able to determine the validity of a given SBML document that uses constructs from the Hierarchical Model Composition package. This section describes operational rules for assessing validity.


\subsection{Validation procedure}
\label{validation-procedure}

The validation rules below only apply to models defined in the SBML document being validated. Models defined in external files are not required to be valid in and of themselves; the only requirement is that the model containing the instantiation of an externally-defined model must be the one that is valid. That may seem counterintuitive, but the reason is that replacements and deletions can be used to render valid what might otherwise be invalid. For example, an external model that omits required attributes on some objects (which would be invalid according to SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core) may become valid if those objects are replaced by objects that \emph{are} valid, or if they are deleted entirely. Similarly, references to nonexistent objects may themselves be deleted, or illegal combinations of objects may be rectified, etc.


\subsubsection{The two-phase validation approach}

To understand the validation procedure for models that use Hierarchical Model Composition, it is helpful to think in terms of an analogy to baking. To make a cake, one first assembles specific ingredients in a certain way, and then one bakes the result to produce the final product---the cake. An SBML document using the Hierarchical Model Composition package constructs is analogous to \emph{only a recipe}: it is a description of how to assemble ingredients in a certain way to create a ``cake'', but it is \emph{not the cake itself}. The cake is only produced after \emph{following} the instructions, which here involves traversing the various model, submodel, deletion, and replacement descriptions.

We decompose validation of such a composite model into two phases:

\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\parskip}{0ex}

\item \emph{Validate the ``recipe''}. The submodel, deletion, and replacement constructs themselves must be valid.

\item \emph{Validate the ``cake''}. The model produced by interpreting the various constructs must be valid SBML.

\end{enumerate}

The first phase involves checking the aggregation, deletion and linkage instructions defined by the Hierarchical Model Composition constructs in an SBML document. The \Submodel, \Port, \Deletion, \ReplacedElement, \ReplacedBy and other constructs defined in this specification must be valid according to the rules defined in \sec{validation-rules}. Passing this phase means that the constructs are well-formed, referenced files and models and other entities exist, ports have identifiers in the relevant namespaces, and so on.

The second validation phase takes place after interpreting the Hierarchical Model Composition constructs. The result of this phase must be a valid SBML model. This verification can in principle be performed in various ways. In this specification, we describe one approach below that involves interpreting the Hierarchical Model Composition constructs to produce a kind of ``flattened'' version of the model devoid of the Hierarchical Model Composition package constructs. The ``flattened'' version of the model only exists in memory: the referenced files are not actually modified, but rather, the interpretation of the package constructs leads to an in-memory representation of a final, composite model implied by following the recipe. This generated model can then be tested against the rules for SBML validity defined in the SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core specification. Performing this ``flattening'' allows for the most straightforward way of testing the validity of the resulting SBML model; however, it is \emph{not part of the requirements for this package}. The requirements are only that the model implied by the package constructs is valid.


\subsubsection{Example algorithm for producing a ``flattened'' model}

\fig{flattening-algo} presents a possible algorithm for interpreting the Hierarchical Model Composition constructs and creating a ``flattened'' SBML document. As explained above, this procedure can be used as part of a process to test the validity of an SBML document that uses Hierarchical Model Composition. After performing the steps of the flattening algorithm, the result should be evaluated for validity according to the normal rules of SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core and (if applicable) the rules defined by any other Level~3 packages used in the model.

 & Let ``\emph{M}'' be the identifier of a given submodel. Verify that no object identifier or meta identifier of objects in that submodel (i.e., the \token{id} or \token{metaid} attribute values) begin with the character sequence ``\emph{M\_\_}''; if there \emph{is} an existing identifier or meta identifier beginning with ``\emph{M\_\_}'', add an underscore to ``\emph{M\_\_}'' (i.e., to produce ``\emph{M\_\_\_}'') and again check that the sequence is unique. Continue adding underscores until you find a unique prefix. Let ``\emph{P}'' stand for this final prefix.
 \\[6pt]

 & Remove all objects that have been replaced or deleted in the submodel.
 \\[6pt]

 & Transform the remaining objects in the submodel as follows:
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=3ex,label={\alph*})]

 \item Change every identifier (\token{id} attribute) to a new value obtained by prepending ``\emph{P}'' to the original identifier.

 \item Change every meta identifier (\token{metaid} attribute) to a new value obtained by prepending ``\emph{P}'' to the original identifier.

 \vspace*{-0.5em}
 \end{enumerate}
 \\

 & Transform every \primtype{SIdRef} and \primtype{IDREF} type value in the remaining objects of the submodel as follows: \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=3ex,label={\alph*})]

 \item If the referenced object has been replaced by the application of a \ReplacedBy or \ReplacedElement construct, change the \primtype{SIdRef} value (respectively, \primtype{IDREF} value) to the \primtype{SId} value (respectively, \primtype{ID} value) of the object replacing it.

 \item If the referenced object has not been replaced, change the \primtype{SIdRef} and \primtype{IDREF} value by prepending ``\emph{P}'' to the original value.

 \vspace*{-0.5em}
 \end{enumerate}
 \\

 & After performing the tasks above for all remaining objects, merge the objects of the remaining submodels into a single model. Merge the various lists (list of species, list of compartments, etc.) in this step, and preserve notes and annotations as well as constructs from other SBML Level~3 packages.

\subsubsection{Additional remarks about the validation procedure}

When \notice instantiating a model, it is not necessary to first test the validity of that model. If it is in the same file as the containing model, it will be tested anyway when the result of the ``flattening'' algorithm is checked for validity in the second phase. If it is in a different file, that file's validity (or lack thereof) should not affect the validity of the file being tested, though a validator may warn the user of this situation if it desires.


\subsection{Validation and consistency rules}
\label{validation-rules}

This section summarizes all the conditions that must (or in some cases, at least \emph{should}) be true of an SBML Level~3 Version~1 model that uses the Hierarchical Model Composition package. We use the same conventions as are used in the SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core specification document. In particular, there are different degrees of rule strictness. Formally, the differences are expressed in the statement of a rule: either a rule states that a condition \emph{must} be true, or a rule states that it \emph{should} be true. Rules of the former kind are strict SBML validation rules---a model encoded in SBML must conform to all of them in order to be considered valid. Rules of the latter kind are consistency rules. To help highlight these differences, we use the following three symbols next to the rule numbers:

\begin{description}

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\vSymbol\vsp] A \vSymbolName indicates a \emph{requirement} for SBML conformance. If a model does not follow this rule, it does not conform to the Hierarchical Model Composition specification. (Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol: ``This must be checked.'')

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\cSymbol\csp] A \cSymbolName indicates a \emph{recommendation} for model consistency. If a model does not follow this rule, it is not considered strictly invalid as far as the Hierarchical Model Composition specification is concerned; however, it indicates that the model contains a physical or conceptual inconsistency. (Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol: ``This is a cause for warning.'')

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\mSymbol\msp] A \mSymbolName indicates a strong recommendation for good modeling practice. This rule is not strictly a matter of SBML encoding, but the recommendation comes from logical reasoning. As in the previous case, if a model does not follow this rule, it is not considered an invalid SBML encoding. (Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol: ``You're a star if you heed this.'')

\end{description}

The validation rules listed in the following subsections are all stated or implied in the rest of this specification document. They are enumerated here for convenience. Unless explicitly stated, all validation rules concern objects and attributes specifically defined in the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

For \notice convenience and brievity, we use the shorthand ``\token{comp:x}'' to stand for an attribute or element name \token{x} in the namespace for the Hierarchical Model Composition package, using the namespace prefix \token{comp}. In reality, the prefix string may be different from the literal ``\token{comp}'' used here (and indeed, it can be any valid XML namespace prefix that the modeler or software chooses). We use ``\token{comp:x}'' because it is shorter than to write a full explanation everywhere we refer to an attribute or element in the Hierarchical Model Composition package namespace.
