The identifier given as the value of the attribute \token{symbol} in
any \InitialAssignment object cannot also appear as the value of the
\token{variable} attribute in an \AssignmentRule object.  In other words, a
model cannot simultaneously define both an initial assignment and an
assignment rule for the same species, compartment or parameter in a model.
