Inside the \token{lambda} MathML element within a \FunctionDefinition
object, if a \token{ci} element is not the first element within a MathML
\token{apply}, then the \token{ci} element's value may only be an
identifier provided as the value of a \token{bvar} element declared in that
\token{lambda}.  This restriction also applies to the \token{csymbol}
objects for \emph{time}, \emph{avogadro}, \changed{\emph{delay} and \emph{rateOf}}.  In other words, all model
quantities and variables referenced inside a function definition must be
passed as arguments to that function.  (References: SBML L3V1 Sections 3.4.3 and 4.3.2; SBML L3V2
\sec{sec:ci-token} and~\sec{sec:function-definition-math}.)
