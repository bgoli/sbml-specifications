There must not be circular dependencies in the combined set of \RateRule and \KineticLaw objects in the model.  Each of these constructs has the effect of assigning a value to the time derivative of one or more identifiers (i.e., the identifier given in the attribute \token{variable} in the \RateRule, and the identifier of any \Species referenced by a \SpeciesReference in the same \Reaction as the \KineticLaw).  Each of these constructs computes the value using a mathematical formula.  The formula used to calculate the time derivative of a given identifier cannot make reference to a second identifier whose own definition depends directly or indirectly on a \emph{rateOf} \token{csymbol} for the first identifier.
