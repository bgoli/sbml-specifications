For every \Species object produced or consumed in a reaction (that is, referenced
by a \SpeciesReference object), the unit of
measurement of the species' substance should be consistent with the unit of 
\emph{extent} for the model times the unit of the conversion
factor for that species.  More precisely, the product of the units indicated by the
\Model object's \token{extentUnits} and the \token{conversionFactor} attribute for
that particular \Species (whether
the attribute is set directly on the \Species object or inherited from
the enclosing \Model object) should be consistent with the unit specified
by that \Species object's \token{substanceUnits} attribute value.  (References:
SBML L3V2 \sec{sec:model-extentUnits}.)
