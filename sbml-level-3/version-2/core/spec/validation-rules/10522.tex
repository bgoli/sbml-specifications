When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in an \InitialAssignment
object refers to a \Species object, the unit of measurement associated with
the \InitialAssignment's \token{math} expression should be consistent with
the unit of that species' quantity.  (References: \tworefs{4.8}{\ref{sec:initialAssignment}}.)
