When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in an \AssignmentRule
object refers to a \SpeciesReference object, the unit of measurement
associated with the rule's right-hand side should be consistent with the
unit of stoichiometry, that is, \token{dimensionless}.  (References: SBML L3V1 Section 4.9.3; SBML
L3V2 \sec{sec:assignmentrule}.)
