When the value of the attribute \token{variable} of an \EventAssignment
object is the identifier of a \SpeciesReference object, the unit of
measurement associated with the \EventAssignment's \token{math} expression
should be consistent with the unit of stoichiometry, i.e.,
\token{dimensionless}.  (References: SBML L3V2
\sec{sec:eventassignment}.)
