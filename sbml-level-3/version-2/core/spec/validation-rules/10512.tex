When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in an \AssignmentRule
object refers to a \Species object, the unit of measurement associated with
the mathematical expression in the rule's MathML \token{math} element
should be consistent with the unit of that species' quantity.  (References:
SBML L3V2 Section~\ref{sec:assignmentrule}.)
