The value of the attribute \token{sboTerm} on an \Event object should be
an SBO identifier referring to a mathematical expression.  That is, the
value should be a term derived from \sbointeractionID,
``\relchange{occurring entity representation}''.  (References: SBML L3V1 Section 5; SBML L3V2 \sec{sec:sbo}.)
