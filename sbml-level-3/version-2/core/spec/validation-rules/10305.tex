In every \Event object, the value of the attribute \token{variable} within
each \EventAssignment subobject must be unique across the set of all such
\EventAssignment subobjects within that particular \Event object.  In other
words, a single \Event cannot make more than one assignment to the same
model component.  (References: SBML L3V2 ~\sec{sec:eventassignment}.)
