There must not be circular dependencies in calculating the rate of change of any model variable.  The \emph{rateOf} \token{csymbol} may not be used directly nor indirectly in the calculation of the rate of change of the variable it references.  In particular, the \RateRule and \KineticLaw constructs are used to calculate rates of change: the formulas they use may not contain \emph{rateOf} \token{csymbols} referencing the model variables whose rates of change they control, nor may they reference variables who in turn are calculated (directly nor indirectly) by using a \emph{rateOf} \token{csymbol} referencing those same changing variables.
