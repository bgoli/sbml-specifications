When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in an \InitialAssignment
object refers to a \Parameter object, the unit of measurement associated
with the \InitialAssignment's \token{math} expression should be consistent
with the unit declared for that parameter's value.  (References: \tworefs{4.8}{\ref{sec:initialAssignment}}.)
