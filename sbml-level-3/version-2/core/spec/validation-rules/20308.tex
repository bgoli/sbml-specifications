Inside the \token{lambda} MathML element within a \FunctionDefinition
object, if the identifier of that object (\ie value of the
\FunctionDefinition's \token{id} attribute) appears as an identifier within a referenced \FunctionDefinition's \token{lambda} MathML element (or as an identifier within another \FunctionDefinition whose identifier is referenced, etc.) the value of its \token{isRecursive} attribute must be \val{true}.  Such usage entails a recursive function call, and this useage must be denoted explicitly.  (References: SBML L3V2
Section~\ref{sec:functiondefinition}.)
