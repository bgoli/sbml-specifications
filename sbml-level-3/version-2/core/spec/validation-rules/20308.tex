Inside the \token{lambda} MathML element within a \FunctionDefinition object, the identifier of that object (\ie value of the \FunctionDefinition's \token{id} attribute) may not appear as an identifier within a referenced \FunctionDefinition's \token{lambda} MathML element (or as an identifier within another \FunctionDefinition whose identifier is referenced, etc.).  Such usage entails a recursive function call, which is not permitted.  (References: SBML L3V2 \sec{sec:functiondefinition}.)
