A \Reaction object must contain at least one \SpeciesReference object,
either in its \token{listOfReactants} or its \token{listOfProducts}
element.  A reaction without any reactant or product species is not
permitted, regardless of whether the reaction has any modifier species.
(References: SBML L3V2 Section~\ref{subsec:speciesreference}.)
