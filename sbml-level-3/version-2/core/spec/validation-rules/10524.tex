When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in an \InitialAssignment
object refers to a \SpeciesReference object, the unit of measurement
associated with the \InitialAssignment's \token{math} expression should be
consistent with the unit of stoichiometry, that is, \token{dimensionless}.
(References: SBML L3V2 Section~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}.)
