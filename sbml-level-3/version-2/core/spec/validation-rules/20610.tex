The quantity of a \Species object in a model cannot be determined
simultaneously by both reactions and rules.  More formally, if the
identifier of a \Species object having attribute values
\token{boundaryCondition}=\val{false} and \token{constant}=\val{false} is
referenced by a \SpeciesReference object anywhere in a model, then this
identifier cannot also appear as the value of a \token{variable} in an
\AssignmentRule or a \RateRule object.  (References: SBML L3V2
\sec{sec:species-constant}.)
