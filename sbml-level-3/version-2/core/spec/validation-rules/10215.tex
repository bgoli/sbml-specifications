Outside of a \FunctionDefinition object, if a MathML \token{ci} element is not the first element within a MathML \token{apply}, then the \token{ci} element's value may only be chosen from \relchange{the following set of identifiers: the identifiers of \Species, \Compartment, \Parameter, \SpeciesReference and \Reaction objects defined in the enclosing \Model object; \reltwo{or }the identifiers of \LocalParameter objects that are children of the \Reaction in which the \FunctionDefinition appears (if it appears inside the \Math object of a \KineticLaw)\vertwo{; and any identifiers (in the \primtype{SId} namespace of the model) belonging to an object class defined by an \sbmlthree package as having mathematical meaning}}.  (References: \tworefs{3.4.3}{\ref{sec:ci-token}}.)
