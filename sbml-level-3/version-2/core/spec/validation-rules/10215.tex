Outside of a \FunctionDefinition object, if a MathML \token{ci} element is
not the first element within a MathML \token{apply}, then the \token{ci}
element's value may only be chosen from the set of identifiers of the
\Species, \Compartment, \Parameter, \SpeciesReference or \Reaction objects
defined in the enclosing \Model object\changed{, or additionally, if the parent MathML object is the child of a \KineticLaw, from the set of identifiers of any \LocalParameter objects that are also children of that \KineticLaw.  In addition, any identifiers in the \primtype{SId} namespace of the model from any element defined in an \sbmlthree package may also be used}.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:ci-token}.)
