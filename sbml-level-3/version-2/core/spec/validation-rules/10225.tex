If the target of a \emph{rateOf} \token{csymbol} function is a \Species with a \token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits} value of \val{false}, the \token{compartment} of that \Species must not appear as the \token{variable} of an \AssignmentRule, nor may its \token{size} be determined by an \AlgebraicRule.  (Reference: SBML L3V2 Section~\ref{sec:csymbol})
