When the value of the attribute \token{variable} of an \EventAssignment
object is the identifier of a \Species object, the unit of measurement
associated with the \EventAssignment's \token{math} expression should be
consistent with the unit of that species' size.  (References: \tworefs{4.12.5}{\ref{sec:eventassignment}}.)
