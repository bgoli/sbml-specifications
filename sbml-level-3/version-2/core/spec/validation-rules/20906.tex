There must not be circular dependencies in the combined set of
\InitialAssignment, \AssignmentRule and \KineticLaw objects in a model.
Each of these constructs has the effect of assigning a value to an
identifier (\ie the identifier given in the attribute \token{symbol} in
\InitialAssignment, the attribute \token{variable} in \AssignmentRule, and
the attribute \token{id} on the \KineticLaw's enclosing \Reaction).  Each
of these constructs computes the value using a mathematical formula.  The
formula for a given identifier cannot make reference to a second identifier
whose own definition depends directly or indirectly on the first
identifier.  (References: \tworefs{4.9.5}{\ref{sec:ruleconstraints}}.)
