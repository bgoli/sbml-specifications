If the attribute \token{units} on a \Compartment object having a
\token{spatialDimensions} attribute value of \val{3} has not been set, then
the unit of measurement associated with the compartment's size is
determined by the value of the enclosing \Model object's
\token{volumeUnits} attribute.  If neither the \Compartment object's
\token{units} nor the enclosing \Model object's \token{volumeUnits}
attributes are set, the unit of compartment size is undefined.
