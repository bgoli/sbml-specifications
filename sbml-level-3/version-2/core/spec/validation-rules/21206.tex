If an \Event object's \token{useValuesFromTriggerTime} attribute has the
value \val{false}, then the \Event object must contain a \Delay subobject.
The implication of \token{useValuesFromTriggerTime}=\val{false} is that
there is a delay between the time of trigger and the time of value
assignments performed by that event.  (References: SBML L3V2
