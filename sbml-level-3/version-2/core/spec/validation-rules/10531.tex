When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in a \RateRule object
refers to a \Compartment object, the unit of measurement associated with
the \RateRule's \token{math} expression should be consistent with \{unit of
compartment size\}/\{unit of \emph{time}\}.  (References: SBML L3V2
\sec{sec:compartment-units}, \sec{sec:timeunits}
and~\sec{sec:raterule}.)
