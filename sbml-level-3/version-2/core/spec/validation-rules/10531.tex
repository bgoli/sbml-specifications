When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in a \RateRule object
refers to a \Compartment object, the unit of measurement associated with
the \RateRule's \token{math} expression should be consistent with \{unit of
compartment size\}/\{unit of \emph{time}\}.  (References: \tworefs{4.5.4, 4.2.4, and 4.9.4}{\ref{sec:compartment-units}, \ref{sec:timeunits},
and~\ref{sec:raterule}}.)
