When the value of the attribute \token{variable} of an \EventAssignment
object is the identifier of a \Parameter object, the unit of measurement
associated with the \EventAssignment's \token{math} expression should be
consistent with the unit declared for that parameter's value.  (References:
SBML L3V2 \sec{sec:eventassignment}.)
