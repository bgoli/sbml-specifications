An identifier used as the value of the attribute \token{variable} of an
\EventAssignment object cannot also appear as the value of the
\token{variable} attribute in an \AssignmentRule object.  In other words, a
given model component cannot be the subject of both an assignment rule and
an assignment by an event.  (References: SBML L3V1 Section 4.12.5; SBML L3V2
\sec{sec:eventassignment}.)
