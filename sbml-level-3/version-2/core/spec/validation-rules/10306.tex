An identifier used as the value of the attribute \token{variable} of an
\EventAssignment object cannot also appear as the value of the
\token{variable} attribute in an \AssignmentRule object.  In other words, a
given model component cannot be the subject of both an assignment rule and
an assignment by an event.  (References: \tworefs{4.12.5}{\ref{sec:eventassignment}}.)
