When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in an \InitialAssignment
object refers to a \Compartment object, the unit of measurement associated
with the \InitialAssignment's \token{math} expression should be consistent
with the unit of that compartment's size.  (References: SBML L3V1 Section 4.8; SBML L3V2
\sec{sec:initialAssignment}.)
