\abstract{While many biological processes can be modeled by abstracting away the space in which those processes occur, some modeling (particularly at the cellular level) requires space itself to be modeled, with processes happening not in well-mixed compartments, but spatially-defined compartments.  The \emph{SBML Level~3 Core} specification does not include an explicit mechanism to encode geometries and spatial processes in a model, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML \emph{packages} to extend the Core specification and add additional syntactic constructs. The SBML \emph{Spatial Processes} package for SBML Level~3 adds the necessary features to allow models to encode geometries and other spatial information about the elements and processes it describes.}
