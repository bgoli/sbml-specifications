\chapter {Syntax and semantics}

The proposal for extending SBML to carry the information for multistate multicomponent species relies on the extension of the following core SBML elements: \class{Species}, \class{InitialAssignment}, \class{Rule}, \class{Reaction}, \class{SimpleSpeciesReference}, \class{EventAssignment}. In addition, the multistate multi-component package requires the creation of new main elements: \class{SpeciesType}, \class{Selector}. 

A software that does not understand \multiVone can ignore entirely all elements in the corresponding namespace. The remaining SBML model is a valid \sbmlLthreeVone core.

In the UML diagrams contained in this specification, the elements and attributes specific to the package \emph{multi} are drawn in red, while the elements and attributes belonging to SBML core are drawn in black. Not all of the latter are drawn, but only the ones needed to "plug" the package \emph{multi}. Please consult the specification of the core for a deeper understanding of SBML at large.
