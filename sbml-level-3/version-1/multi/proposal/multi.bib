The output defines and parameterizes the network of molecular species that can arise during signaling and provides functions that relate model variables to experimental readouts of interest. Models that can be generated are relevant for rational drug discovery, analysis of proteomic data and mechanistic studies of signal transduction.

@article{Hlavacek:2006,
    abstract = {Formalized rules for protein-protein interactions have recently been introduced to represent the binding and enzymatic activities of proteins in cellular signaling. Rules encode an understanding of how a system works in terms of the biomolecules in the system and their possible states and interactions. A set of rules can be as easy to read as a diagrammatic interaction map, but unlike most such maps, rules have precise interpretations. Rules can be processed to automatically generate a mathematical or computational model for a system, which enables explanatory and predictive insights into the system's behavior. Rules are independent units of a model specification that facilitate model revision. Instead of changing a large number of equations or lines of code, as may be required in the case of a conventional mathematical model, a protein interaction can be introduced or modified simply by adding or changing a single rule that represents the interaction of interest. Rules can be defined and visualized by using graphs, so no specialized training in mathematics or computer science is necessary to create models or to take advantage of the representational precision of rules. Rules can be encoded in a machine-readable format to enable electronic storage and exchange of models, as well as basic knowledge about protein-protein interactions. Here, we review the motivation for rule-based modeling; applications of the approach; and issues that arise in model specification, simulation, and testing. We also discuss rule visualization and exchange and the software available for rule-based modeling.},

    abstract = {<p>The signaling network underlying eukaryotic chemosensing is a complex combination of receptor-mediated transmembrane signals, lipid modifications, protein translocations, and differential activation/deactivation of membrane-bound and cytosolic components. As such, it provides particularly interesting challenges for a combined computational and experimental analysis. We developed a novel detailed molecular signaling model that, when used to simulate the response to the attractant cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), made nontrivial predictions about <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> chemosensing. These predictions, including the unexpected existence of spatially asymmetrical, multiphasic, cyclic adenosine monophosphate–induced PTEN translocation and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> generation, were experimentally verified by quantitative single-cell microscopy leading us to propose significant modifications to the current standard model for chemoattractant-induced biochemical polarization in this organism. Key to this successful modeling effort was the use of “Simmune,” a new software package that supports the facile development and testing of detailed computational representations of cellular behavior. An intuitive interface allows user definition of complex signaling networks based on the definition of specific molecular binding site interactions and the subcellular localization of molecules. It automatically translates such inputs into spatially resolved simulations and dynamic graphical representations of the resulting signaling network that can be explored in a manner that closely parallels wet lab experimental procedures. These features of Simmune were critical to the model development and analysis presented here and are likely to be useful in the computational investigation of many aspects of cell biology.</p>},

@article{MortonFirth:1998,
    abstract = {We used a newly developed stochastic-based program to predict the fluctuations in numbers of molecules in a chemotactic signalling pathway of coliform bacteria. Specifically, we examined temporal changes in molecules of CheYp, a cytoplasmic protein known to influence the direction of rotation of the flagellar motor. Signalling molecules in the vicinity of a flagellar motor were represented as individual software objects interacting according to probabilities derived from experimentally-observed concentrations rate constants. The simulated CheYp molecules were found to undergo random fluctuations in number about an average corresponding to the deterministically calculated concentration. Both the relative amplitude of the fluctuations, as a proportion of the total number of molecules, and their average duration, increased as the simulated volume was reduced. In a simulation corresponding to 10\% of the volume of a bacterium, the average duration of fluctuations was found to be 80.7 ms, which is much shorter than the observed alternations between clockwise and counter clockwise rotations of tethered bacteria (typically 2.6 s). Our results are therefore not in agreement with a simple threshold-crossing model for motor switching. However, it is possible to filter the CheYp fluctuations to produce temporal distributions closer to the observed swimming behaviour and we discuss the possible implications for the control of motor rotation.},
