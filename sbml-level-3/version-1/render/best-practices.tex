\section{Best practices}
\label{best-practices}

In this section, we recommend a number of practices for using and
interpreting various constructs in the \RenderPackage.
These recommendations are non-normative, but we advocate them strongly;
ignoring them will not render a model invalid, but may reduce
inter-operability between software and models.

\need{things I noticed from text - but I'm sure it is not complete}

\subsection{Text}

A \Text has an optional attribute \token{font-family} of type
\FontFamily.  This limits the 
choice of the \token{font-family} attribute to the generic families \val{serif}, \val{sans-serif}
and \val{monospace} and is is recommended good practice to use only these fonts to allow for greater exchangeability.

\subsection{Image}

If the referenced resource can not be found, it is up to the application if nothing is drawn or some place holder is displayed.
Preferably the user would get some kind of notification about the missing resource.
