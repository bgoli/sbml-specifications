\section{Best practices}
\label{best-practices}

In this section, we recommend a number of practices for using and
interpreting various constructs in the \RenderPackage.
These recommendations are non-normative, but we advocate them strongly;
ignoring them will not render a model invalid, but may reduce
interoperability between software and models.

\subsection{Text}

A \Text has an optional attribute \token{font-family} of type
\primtype{string} that allows to specify the font or font-family to be used for 
the text element. For maximum interoperability the font families specified in 
\FontFamily have to be supported at a minimum. Those are the generic families 
\val{serif}, \val{sans-serif} and \val{monospace}. Is is recommended good 
practice to use only these fonts to allow for greater exchangeability.

\subsection{Image}

If the referenced resource can not be found, it is up to the application if 
nothing is drawn or some place holder is displayed. Preferably the user would 
get some kind of notification about the missing resource.
