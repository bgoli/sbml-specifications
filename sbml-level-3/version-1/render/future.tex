\section{Future development}
\label{future}

In this section we highlight some open issues not addressed in this version
of the \Render specification.


\need{I just put in things as the text indicated they were not considered;}

\subsection{Values for \class{StyleType}}


Concerning the valid 
keywords for the \token{roleList} attribute we had thought about taking those 
from some kind of controlled vocabulary. Preferably, this would be some kind of 
ontology like SBO. The specifics of this will have to be discussed with other 
interested parties

\subsection{3D drawings}

Both the transformations and graphical primitives considered here have been limited to the 2D situation. 

\subsection{Text}

outlined or filled-outlined text are not supported.

\subsection{Image}

To include bitmaps into a graphical representation we use the \Image element 
from SVG. The \Image element in SVG can also be used to include complete SVG 
vector images which we explicitly exclude in this version of the proposal 
since we think it would be too complex. If the need for the inclusion of SVG 
drawings arises, it is only a matter of rephrasing this specification.


Non-local image resources (e.g. from the net) are currently not supported.
