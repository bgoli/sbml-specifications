\section{Acknowledgments}

We thank all the participants of the Harmony and Combine workshops and
those involved in the Arrays Package Working Group who contributed ideas and discussion over
the years.

In addition we would like to thank the authors (esp. Mike and Lucian) of the `contrib' package whose text was used as an inspiration (and occasionally literally).
