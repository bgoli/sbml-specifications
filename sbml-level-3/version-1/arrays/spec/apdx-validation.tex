\section{Validation Rules}
\label{validation}

This section summarizes all the conditions that must (or in some cases,
at least \emph{should}) be true of an SBML Level~3 Version~1 model that
uses the Arrays package.  We use the same
conventions as are used in the SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core specification
document.  In particular, there are different degrees of rule
strictness.  Formally, the differences are expressed in the statement of
a rule: either a rule states that a condition \emph{must} be true, or a
rule states that it \emph{should} be true.  Rules of the former kind are
strict SBML validation rules---a model encoded in SBML must conform to
all of them in order to be considered valid.  Rules of the latter kind
are consistency rules.  To help highlight these differences, we use the
following three symbols next to the rule numbers:

\begin{description}

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\vSymbol\vsp] A \vSymbolName indicates a
  \emph{requirement} for SBML conformance. If a model does not follow
  this rule, it does not conform to the Arrays
  specification.  (Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol:
  ``This must be checked.'')

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\cSymbol\csp] A \cSymbolName indicates a
  \emph{recommendation} for model consistency.  If a model does not
  follow this rule, it is not considered strictly invalid as far as the
  Arrays specification is concerned; however, it
  indicates that the model contains a physical or conceptual
  inconsistency.  (Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol:
  ``This is a cause for warning.'')

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\mSymbol\msp] A \mSymbolName indicates a strong
  recommendation for good modeling practice.  This rule is not strictly
  a matter of SBML encoding, but the recommendation comes from logical
  reasoning.  As in the previous case, if a model does not follow this
  rule, it is not considered an invalid SBML encoding.  (Mnemonic
  intention behind the choice of symbol: ``You're a star if you heed
  this.'')

\end{description}

The validation rules listed in the following subsections are all stated
or implied in the rest of this specification document.  They are
enumerated here for convenience.  Unless explicitly stated, all
validation rules concern objects and attributes specifically defined in
the Arrays package.

For \notice convenience and brievity, we use the shorthand
``\token{arrays:x}'' to stand for an attribute or element name \token{x}
in the namespace for the Arrays package, using
the namespace prefix \token{arrays}.  In reality, the prefix string may be
different from the literal ``\token{arrays}'' used here (and indeed, it
can be any valid XML namespace prefix that the modeler or software
chooses).  We use ``\token{arrays:x}'' because it is shorter than to
write a full explanation everywhere we refer to an attribute or element
in the Arrays package namespace.

\section{Example algorithm for producing a ``flattened'' model}
\label{flatten}
The algorithms below provide a method for interpreting the Arrays constructs and creating a ``flattened'' SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core document.  Algorithm~\ref{flattenArrays} considers each \SBase object in a \Model.  If this object has dimensions, then it calls Algorithm~\ref{expandDimension} recursively to expand each dimension.  Algorithm~\ref{expandDimension} creates a clone of the object for each member of the array within the current dimension in which the id is given a unique value based on its position in that array dimension.  It also replaces the current dimension id with this value, as well.  Finally, it recursively calls Algorithm~\ref{expandDimension} to expand the next dimension.  Once all dimensions have been expanded, this algorithm evaluates the indices.  It considers each attribute being indexed in turn.  For each index dimension in reverse order, it updates the id being referenced by that attribute.  Finally, it adds the final flattened object to the document.  Once Algorithm~\ref{expandDimension} completes, the original object is removed from the document.  Finally, once all arrayed objects are flattened, Algorithm~\ref{flattenArrays} evaluates all selectors and replaces them with the corresponding flattened ids.

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
\label{flattenArrays}
  \caption{flattenArrays(SBMLDocument document)}
\ForEach{sBase in Model(document)}
{
        \If{dimensionCount(sBase)>0} 
        {
          expandDimension(document, sBase, dimensionCount(sBase) - 1)\;
          remove(document, sBase)\;
        }
}
Evaluate all selectors and replace with new ids\;
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
\label{expandDimension}
  \caption{expandDimension(SBMLDocument document, SBase sBase, int currentDimension)}
%\ForEach{SBase sbase}
%{
       \If{currentDimension $\geq 0$}
       {
         	\For{$i := 0; i < \textup{size(sBase, currentDimension)}; i++$}
                {
                        sBase':=clone(sBase)\;
                        id(sBase', id(sBase) + ``\_'' + i)\;
                        replace(sBase', dimensionId(currentDimension), i)\;
                        expandDimension(document,sBase',currentDimension-1)\;
               }
     }
     \Else
     {
       	\ForEach{attribute with an index for sBase}
                {
                 	\For{$i := indexCount(sBase,attribute)-1; i>=0; i--$}
                        {
                           attribute(sBase) := attribute(sBase) + ``\_'' + evaluate(indexMath(sBase,attribute,i))\;
                        }
                }
                add(document, sBase)\;
     }
%}
\end{algorithm}

After performing the steps of the flattening algorithm, the result should be evaluated for validity according to the normal rules of SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core and (if applicable) the rules defined by any other Level~3 packages used in the model.  However, it is our belief that a valid SBML document with arrays will always flatten into an valid SBML document without arrays.
