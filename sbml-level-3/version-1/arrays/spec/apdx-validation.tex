\section{Validation Rules}
\label{validation}

% If you look at the apdx-validation.tex file for any of the accepted packages you will see the macros in use.

% You can also probably cut and paste the opening paragraphs :-)

% Note with the numbers for arrays they will be

% arrays-nnnnn

% and then the first three numbers should be consistent with the categories from core for the more general 10xxx types rules; so
% 101xx for general xml rules
% 102xx for mathml rules
% etc

% Specific component type rules would be 20nxx where n is a new number for each component.

% So Dimension related rules would be 201xx

% and Index ones would be 202xx

%  Yes indeed.  I assume you are using the sbmlpkgspec latex class.  In the documentation for that class (which is in a PDF file with the sbmlpkgclass style file kit, https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/specifications/tex/) see section 2.9.
