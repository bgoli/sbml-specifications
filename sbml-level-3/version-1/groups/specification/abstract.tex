Biological models often contain components that are related to one another.  The \emph{SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core} specification does not directly provide a mechanism for defining these relationships, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML \emph{packages} to extend the Core specification and add additional syntactical constructs.  The SBML \emph{Groups} package for SBML Level~3 adds the necessary features to SBML to allow grouping of related model elements.  The package enables a modeler to include definitions of groups and nested groups, each of which may be annotated to convey why that group was created, and what it represents.
