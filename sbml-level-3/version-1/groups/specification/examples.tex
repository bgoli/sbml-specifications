\section{Examples}
\label{examples}

This section contains examples employing the Groups package for SBML Level~3.

\subsection{Simple species typing via annotations}

The following is a simple example of using this proposed grouping facility to do something similar to the \SpeciesType example shown in Section~4.6.3 of the SBML Level~2 Version~4 specification (p.~43).

In this example, both species \val{ATPc} and \val{ATPm} are intended to be pools of ATP, but located in different compartments.  To indicate that they are both conceptually the same kid of molecular entity, the model includes a group definition of the \val{classification} variety.  The two species \val{ATPc} and \val{ATPm} are both listed as members of the same group.  The group definition could be enhanced further by including an annotation that references the ChEBI database entry for ATP; we omit that detail here in order to concentrate on the Groups constructs.


\subsection{Nested groups}

The following example illustrates a case of nested groups.
