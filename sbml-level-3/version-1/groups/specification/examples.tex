\section{Examples}
\label{examples}

This section contains examples employing the Groups package for SBML Level~3.

\subsection{Simple species typing via annotations}
\label{examples-speciestype}

The following is a simple example of using this proposed grouping facility to do something similar to the \SpeciesType example shown in Section~4.6.3 of the SBML Level~2 Version~4 specification (p.~43).

%In this example, both species \val{ATPc} and \val{ATPm} are intended to be pools of ATP, but located in different compartments.  To indicate that they are both conceptually the same kind of molecular entity, the model includes a group definition of the \val{classification} variety.  The two species \val{ATPc} and \val{ATPm} are both listed as members of the same group.  The \ListOfMembers is given the \token{sboTerm} \val{SBO:0000248} to indicate that both species are small molecules.  Four restrictions are set in place by the \ListOfMemberConstraints element:  both species must be the same type, must be in different \token{compartments}, and must share the same \token{initialConcentration} and \token{constant} values.

In this example, both \val{ATPc} and \val{ATPm} are intended to be pools of ATP, but located in different compartments.  To indicate that they are both conceptually the same kind of molecular entity, the model includes a group definition of the \val{classification} variety.  The two species \val{ATPc} and \val{ATPm} are both listed as members of the same group.  The \ListOfMembers is given the \token{sboTerm} \val{SBO:0000248} to indicate that both species are small molecules.
This group definition could be enhanced further by including an annotation on the \ListOfMembers that references the ChEBI database entry for ATP; we omit that detail here in order to concentrate on the Groups constructs.


\subsection{Example using meta identifiers}

In the next example, two rules both influence a model in the same way, so a group is used to collect the rules and annotate them.

\exampleFile{figs/rule-example.xml}

The key point of this example is the use of meta identifiers for SBML entities (in particular, rules) that do not have regular identifiers (i.e., \token{id} attributes).
