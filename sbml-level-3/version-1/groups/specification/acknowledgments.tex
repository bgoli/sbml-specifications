\section{Acknowledgments}

Work such as this does not take place in a vacuum; many people contributed ideas and discussions that shaped the Groups proposal that you see before you.  We particularly thank Nicolas Le Nov\`{e}re, Frank Bergmann, Sarah Keating, Allyson Lister, Robert Phair, Sven Sahle, Stefan Hoops, Chris Myers, and the members of the \emph{sbml-discuss} and \emph{sbml-groups} mailing lists for suggestions and comments.

We would also like to thank \changed{Andreas Dr{\"a}eger, Ben Heavner, Brett Olivier, Kieran Smallbone, and Anna Zhukova for their work in implementing 'Groups' support in their own software tools, with Brett in particular investigating implementaton of the 'nested groups' aspect of the specification.}
