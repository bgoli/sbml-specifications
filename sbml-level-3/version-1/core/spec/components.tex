\section{SBML components}
\label{sec:elements}

In this section, we define each of the major components of SBML.
We use the UML notation described in
Section~\ref{sec:notation-uml} for defining classes of objects.
We also illustrate the use of SBML components by giving partial
model definitions in XML.  Section~\ref{sec:xml-rep} provides many
complete example models encoded in SBML.


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The SBML container}
\label{sec:sbml}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All well-formed SBML documents must begin with an \emph{XML
  declaration}, which specifies both the version of XML assumed
and the document character encoding.  The declaration begins with
the characters \token{<?xml} followed by the XML \token{version}
and \token{encoding} attributes.  SBML \thisL uses XML version 1.0
and requires a document encoding of UTF-8.  Following this
declaration, the outermost portion of a model expressed in \thisL
consists of an object of class \Sbml, defined in
Figure~\ref{fig:sbml}.  This class contains three required
attributes (\token{level}, \token{version} and \token{xmlns}), and
a required \token{model} element.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \small
  \begin{tikzpicture}[level distance=1.05in]
    \node { \emptyClassbox{\textsl{SBase}} }
      [open triangle 60-,edge from parent fork down,sibling distance=2.75in]
      child {node (a) {
          \begin{classbox}{Sbml}
            xmlns: string \{ "http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core" \} \\
            level: positiveInteger \{ use="required" fixed="3" \}   \\
            version: positiveInteger \{ use="required" fixed="1" \} \\
            \{ \emph{Additional attributes permitted} \} \\
          \end{classbox}
        }}
      child {node (b) {
          \emptyClassbox{Model}
        }}
     ;
     \draw[diamond-] (a) -- (b) 
       node[above=6pt,left=0.65in] {\textsf{model}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The definition of \Sbml for SBML \thisLV.  The class
    \Model is defined in Section~\ref{sec:model}.  Note that \Sbml
    and \Model are subclasses of \SBase, and therefore inherit
    the attributes of that abstract class.}
  \label{fig:sbml}
\end{figure}

The following is an abbreviated example of \Sbml translated into
XML form for an SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core document (and here,
ellipses are used to indicate content elided from this example):

\begin{example}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core" level="3" version="1">
  ...
  <model ...>
     ...
  </model>
</sbml>
\end{example}

The attribute \token{xmlns} declares the XML namespace used within
the \token{sbml} element.  The URI for SBML \thisLV is
\uri{http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core}.  All SBML
\thisLV elements and attributes must be placed in this namespace
either by assigning the default namespace as shown in the example
above, or using a tag prefix on every element.  The \token{sbml}
element may contain additional attributes, in particular,
attributes to support the inclusion of SBML Level~3 packages; see
Section~\ref{sec:sbml-packages}.  For purposes of checking
conformance to the SBML Level~3 \emph{Core} specification, only
the elements and attributes in the SBML Level~3 Core XML namespace
are considered.


\subsubsection{The \token{model} element}

The actual model contained within an SBML document is defined by
an instance of the \Model class element.  The structure of this
object and its use are described in Section~\ref{sec:model}.
Every SBML document must contain one model definition.  (As a
result of extension packages defined in SBML Level~3, it is
possible that a model is composed of multiple submodels; however,
there must still be \emph{one} top-level model defining the
structure of the overall composition.)


\subsubsection{Package declarations}
\label{sec:sbml-packages}

SBML Level~3 is modular, in the sense of having a defined core set
of features and optional packages adding features on top of the
core.  This modular approach means that models can declare which
feature-sets they use, and likewise, software tools can declare
which packages they support.  The mechanism for models to declare
which packages they use involves two parts: a standard XML
namespace declaration, and an attribute that every package must
declare in this namespace.
\begin{enumerate}

\item Every SBML Level~3 package is identified uniquely by an XML
  namespace URI.  The use of a given SBML Level~3 package must be
  declared by a model using the standard XML namespace declaration
  approach.  The declaration is made using the character sequence
  \val{xmlns:} (without the quotes), followed by additional
  characters providing a prefix by which elements and attributes
  in that namespace are known in the rest of the SBML document,
  and finally followed by the namespace URI as a value.  The
  following is an example of namespace declarations for a package
  nicknamed \val{multi} and another package nicknamed \val{layout}
  (and here, ellipses are used to indicate content elided from
  this example):
  \begin{example}
<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core" level="3" version="1"
      xmlns:multi="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/multi/version1"
      xmlns:layout="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/layout/version1" ...>
  ...  
  </sbml>\end{example}
  There are no restrictions on the prefixes used for XML namespaces
  referring to SBML Level~3 packages beyond those imposed by the
  relevant specifications of XML~1.0 and XML namespaces.  (In other
  words, the prefix strings \val{multi} and \val{layout} in the
  example above are arbitrarily chosen, and could have been
  something else.)

\item SBML Level~3 requires that every package defines the
  addition of at least one attribute named \token{required}.  The
  attribute, being in the namespace of the Level~3 package in
  question, must be referenced by the XML namespace prefix
  described in point number 1 above.  The value of the
  \token{required} attribute indicates whether understanding the
  package is required for complete mathematical interpretation of
  a model, or whether the package is optional.  A value of
  \token{required}=\val{true} indicates that interpreting the
  package is required.  The following is an example:
  \begin{example}
<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core" level="3" version="1"
      xmlns:multi="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/multi/version1"
      xmlns:layout="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/layout/version1"
      multi:required="true"
      layout:required="false" ... >
...
</sbml>   \end{example}
  If a package is declared optional, it means that the elements and
  attributes added by the package can be ignored without any loss of
  meaning of the model's full mathematics.  ``Ignoring'' a package
  can be accomplished in multiple ways; a reader could either skip
  those elements or attributes altogether during parsing, or read
  them but not interpret them, or do something similar.

\end{enumerate}

The XML namespace declaration for an SBML Level~3 package is an
indication that a model makes use of features defined by that
package, while the \token{required} attribute indicates whether
the features may be ignored without compromising the mathematical
meaning of the model.  Both are necessary for a complete reference
to an SBML Level~3 package.  (On the other hand, no declaration is
necessary for the Level~3 Core package, since it is the base
package and support for it is required in any case.)



% 2009-07-12 <mhucka@caltech.edu>
% My current thinking is that we don't need to have this in the
% Core spec.
%
% \subsubsection{Versioning scheme}
% \label{sec:package-versioning}
%
% All additional packages besides the Core are built on top of the
% core.  Conceptually, all packages are placed the same level in a
% hierarchy rooted under the XML namespace URI
% \val{http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3}.  The versioning scheme for
% packages is described below.
%
% \begin{itemize}
%
% \item The root version number in the SBML namespace URI refers to
%   the version of the Core package.  For example,
%   \val{http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1} indicates the
%   version of the SBML Level 3 Core package.
%
% \item All other packages are numbered sequentially using
%   monotonically increasing integers, regardless of the version of
%   the Core package.
%
% \end{itemize}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Model}
\label{sec:model}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The definition of \Model is shown in Figure~\vref{fig:model}.
Only one instance of a \Model object is allowed per instance of an
SBML \thisLV document or data stream, and it must be located
inside the \token{<sbml> ...\ </sbml>} element as described in
Section~\ref{sec:sbml}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figs/model-uml}
  \caption{The definition of \Model and the many helper
      classes \ListOfFunctionDefinitions, \ListOfUnitDefinitions,
      \ListOfCompartments, \ListOfSpecies, \ListOfParameters,
      \ListOfInitialAssignments, \ListOfRules, \ListOfConstraints,
      \ListOfReactions, and \ListOfEvents.}
  \label{fig:model}
\end{figure}

\Model serves as a container for components of classes
\FunctionDefinition, \UnitDefinition, \Compartment, \Species, \Parameter,
\InitialAssignment, \Rule, \Constraint, \Reaction and \Event.
Instances of the classes are placed inside instances of classes
\ListOfFunctionDefinitions, \ListOfUnitDefinitions,
\ListOfCompartments, \ListOfSpecies, \ListOfParameters, \ListOfInitialAssignments,
\ListOfRules, \ListOfConstraints, \ListOfReactions, and
\ListOfEvents.  The ``list'' classes are defined in
Figure~\ref{fig:model}.  All of the lists are optional, but if a
given list container is present within the model, the list must
not be empty; that is, it must have length one or more.  The
resulting XML data object for a full model containing every
possible list would have the following form:

\newcommand{\sayOptional}{\raisebox{0pt}[0pt][0pt]{\bigg\} \textrm{\emph{optional}}}}

\end{tt}
\vspace*{2ex}

Although the lists are optional, there are dependencies between
SBML components, such that defining some components requires
defining others.  For example, defining a species requires
defining a compartment, and defining a reaction requires defining
a species.  Such dependencies are explained throughout this
document.
  

\subsubsection{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}
\label{sec:model-id}

The \Model object has an optional attribute, \token{id}, used to
give the model an identifier.  The value of \token{id} must
conform to the syntax permitted by the \primtype{SId} data type
described in Section~\ref{sec:sid}.  \Model also has an optional
\token{name} attribute, of type \primtype{string}.  The
\token{name} and \token{id} attributes must be used as described
in Section~\ref{sec:idnameattribs}.


\subsubsection{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}
\label{sec:model-sboterm}

\Model inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a \Model instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type \Model 
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}. 
The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the overall process or phenomenon represented
by the overall SBML model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{The \token{substanceUnits} attribute}
\label{sec:model-substanceUnits}
\label{sec:substanceunits}

The \token{substanceUnits} attribute specifies the units of
measurement associated with substance quantities of \Species
objects that do not themselves specify the units.  The attribute's
value must be of type \primtype{UnitSIdRef}
(Section~\ref{sec:unitsidref}).  A list of recommended units is
given in Section~\ref{sec:bp:unitdefinitions:recommendedunits}.

If a given \Species object definition does not specify units of
substance via the \token{substanceUnits} attribute on \Species
(described in Section~\ref{sec:species}), then the species
quantity inherits the units specified by the \Model
\token{substanceUnits} attribute.  If the \Model does not define a
value for this attribute, then there are no units to inherit, and
all species that do not specify individual \token{substanceUnits}
attribute values then have \emph{no} declared units for their
quantities.  Section~\ref{sec:species-substanceunits} provides
more information about the units of species quantities.

Note that the overall units associated with the identifier of a
species (when that identifier appears in a model's mathematical
expressions) are \emph{not solely determined} by setting
\token{substanceUnits} on \Model or \Species.
Sections~\ref{sec:species-units} and~\ref{sec:species-meaning}
explain this point in more detail.


\subsubsection{The \token{timeUnits} attribute}
\label{sec:model-timeUnits}
\label{sec:timeunits}

The \token{timeUnits} attribute specifies the units in which time
is measured in the model.  The value of this attribute must be of
type \primtype{UnitSIdRef} (Section~\ref{sec:unitsidref}).  A
list of recommended units is given in
Section~\ref{sec:bp:unitdefinitions:recommendedunits}.

This attribute on \Model is the \emph{only} way to specify the
units of time for a model.  It is a global attribute; time is
measured in the same units everywhere in the model.  This is
particularly relevant to \Reaction and \RateRule objects in a
model: all \Reaction and \RateRule objects in SBML define per-time
values, and the time units are those given by the
\token{timeUnits} attribute on the \Model object instance.  If the
\Model \token{timeUnits} attribute has no value, it means that the
units of time are not defined for the model's reactions and rate
rules.  Leaving the units unspecified in an SBML model does not
result in an invalid model; however, as a matter of best practice,
we strongly recommend that all models specify the units of
measurement for time.


\subsubsection{The \token{volumeUnits}, \token{areaUnits} and
  \token{lengthUnits} attributes}
\label{sec:model-volumeUnits}
\label{sec:model-areaUnits}
\label{sec:model-lengthUnits}
\label{volumeunits}
\label{areaunits}
\label{lengthunits}

The attributes \token{volumeUnits}, \token{areaUnits} and
\token{lengthUnits} together are used to set the units of
measurement for the sizes of \Compartment objects in the model
when those objects do not otherwise specify the units.  The three
attributes correspond to the different possible integral
dimensions of compartments; that is, \token{volumeUnits} is
applicable to compartments having
\token{spatialDimensions}=\val{3}, \token{areaUnits} is applicable
to compartments having \token{spatialDimensions}=\val{2}, and
\token{lengthUnits} to compartments having
\token{spatialDimensions}=\val{1}.  The values of these attributes
must be of type \primtype{UnitSIdRef}
(Section~\ref{sec:unitsidref}).  A list of recommended units is
given in Section~\ref{sec:bp:unitdefinitions:recommendedunits}.
The attributes are not applicable to compartments whose
\token{spatialDimensions} attribute value is not one of \val{1},
\val{2} or \val{3}.

If a given \Compartment object instance does not provide a value
for its \token{units} attribute, then that compartment's size
units are inherited from the units specified by the \Model
\token{volumeUnits}, \token{areaUnits} or \token{lengthUnits}
attribute, as appropriate based on the \Compartment object's
\token{spatialDimensions} attribute value.  If the \Model object
does not define the relevant units attribute, then there are no
units to inherit, and all compartments that do not set a value for
the \Compartment \token{units} attribute then have \emph{no}
declared units for the compartment size.
Section~\ref{sec:compartment-units} provides more information
about the units of compartment sizes.

The use of three separate attributes is a carry-over from SBML
Level~2.  Note that it is entirely possible for a model to define
a value for two or more of the attributes \token{volumeUnits},
\token{areaUnits} and \token{lengthUnits} simultaneously, because
SBML models may contain compartments with different numbers of
dimensions.


\subsubsection{The \token{extentUnits} attribute}
\label{sec:model-extentUnits}
\label{extentunits}

Reactions are processes that occur over time.  These processes
involve events of some sort, where a single ``reaction event'' is
one in which some set of entities (known as reactants, products
and modifiers in SBML) interact, once.  The \emph{extent} of a
reaction is a measure of how many times the reaction has occurred,
while the time derivative of the extent gives the instantaneous
rate at which the reaction is occurring.  Thus, what is
colloquially referred to as the ``rate of the reaction'' is in
fact equal to the rate of change of reaction extent.

The combination of \token{extentUnits} and \token{timeUnits}
defines the units of kinetic laws in SBML; this establishes how
the numerical value of each \KineticLaw's mathematical formula
(Section~\ref{subsec:kinetic-law}) is meant to be interpreted in a
model.  The units of the kinetic laws are taken to be
\token{extentUnits} divided by \token{timeUnits}.  A list of
recommended units is given in
Section~\ref{sec:bp:unitdefinitions:recommendedunits}.

Note that this embodies an important principle in SBML models:
\emph{all reactions in an SBML model must have the same units} for
the rate of change of extent.  In other words, the units of all
reaction rates in the model \emph{must be the same}.  There is
only one global value for \token{extentUnits} and one global value
for \token{timeUnits}.


\subsubsection{The \token{conversionFactor} attribute}
\label{sec:model-conversionFactor}

The attribute \token{conversionFactor} defines a global value
inherited by all \Species object instances that do not define
separate values for their \token{conversionFactor} attribute.  The
value of this attribute must be of type \primtype{SIdRef}
(Section~\ref{sec:sidref}) and refer to a \Parameter object
instance defined in the model.  The \Parameter object in question
must be a constant; \ie it must have its \token{constant}
attribute value set to \val{true}.

If a given \Species object definition does not specify a
conversion factor via the \token{conversionFactor} attribute on
\Species (described in Section~\ref{sec:species}), then the
species quantity inherits the conversion factor specified by the
\Model \token{conversionFactor} attribute.  If the \Model does not
define a value for this attribute, then there is no conversion
factor to inherit.  Section~\ref{sec:about-kinetic-laws} describes
how to interpret the effects of reactions on species in that
situation.  More information about conversion factors in SBML is
provided in Sections~\ref{sec:species} and~\ref{sec:reactions}.


\subsubsection{The ListOf container classes}
\label{sec:listof}
\label{sec:listofunitdefinitions}
\label{sec:listoffunctiondefinitions}
\label{sec:listofcompartments}
\label{sec:listofspecies}
\label{sec:listofparameters}
\label{sec:listofinitialassignments}
\label{sec:listofinitialassign}
\label{sec:listofrules}
\label{sec:listofconstraints}
\label{sec:listofreactions}
\label{sec:listofevents}

The various \ListOf classes defined in Figure~\ref{fig:model} are
merely containers used for organizing the main components of an
SBML document.  \ListOfFunctionDefinitions,
\ListOfUnitDefinitions, \ListOfCompartments, \ListOfSpecies,
\ListOfParameters, \ListOfInitialAssignments, \ListOfRules,
\ListOfConstraints, \ListOfReactions, and \ListOfEvents are all
derived from the abstract class \SBase (Section~\ref{sec:sbase}),
and inherit \SBase's various attributes and subelements.  The
\ListOf classes do not add any attributes of their own.

There are several motivations for grouping SBML components within
XML elements named after \token{listOfClassNames} rather than
placing all the components directly at the top level.  First, the
fact that the container classes are derived from \SBase means that
software tools can add information about the lists themselves into
each list container's \Annotation, a feature that a number
of today's software tools exploit.  Second, we believe the
grouping leads to a more modular structure that is helpful when
working with elements from multiple SBML Level~3 packages.  Third,
we believe that it makes visual reading of models in XML easier,
for situations when humans must inspect and edit SBML directly.


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Function definitions}
\label{sec:functiondefinition}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The \FunctionDefinition object associates an identifier with a
function definition.  This identifier can then be used as the
function called in subsequent MathML \token{apply} elements.
\FunctionDefinition is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mathdefinition}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \small
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[above=0.4in] (a) {
      \emptyClassbox{\textsl{SBase}}
    };
    \node (b) {
      \begin{classbox}{\textcolor{black}{FunctionDefinition}}
        id: SId                           \\
        name: string \{ use="optional" \} \\
      \end{classbox}
    };
    \node[right=1.6in] (c) {
      \begin{classbox}{Lambda}
        xmlns: string \{ "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" \} \\
        \{ \emph{\mathml content restricted to one \mathml \token{lambda}} \\[-1pt]
        \emph{or one \token{semantics} element containing a \token{lambda}. \}} \\
      \end{classbox}
    };
    \draw[open triangle 60-] (a) -- (b);
    \draw[diamond-,shorten <=-3pt,shorten >=-6pt] (b) -- (c)
        node[above=6pt,left=1.8in] {\textsf{math}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The definition of class \FunctionDefinition.  A
    \class{Lambda} class object must contain a single \mathml
    \token{lambda} expression (or a \token{lambda} surrounded by a
    \token{semantics} element).  A function definition must
    contain exactly one \token{math} element defined by the
    \class{Lambda} class.  Note also that \class{Lambda} is not
    derived from \SBase, which means that the attributes defined
    on \SBase are \emph{not} available on the \token{math}
    element.  A sequence of one or more instances of
    \FunctionDefinition objects can be located in an instance of
    \ListOfFunctionDefinitions in \Model, as shown in
    Figure~\protect\ref{fig:model}.}
  \label{fig:mathdefinition}
  \label{fig:functionDefinition}
\end{figure}

Function definitions in SBML (also informally known as
``user-defined functions'') have purposefully limited capabilities.
As is made clearer below, a function cannot reference
parameters or other model quantities outside of itself; values
must be passed as parameters to the function.  Moreover, recursive
and mutually-recursive functions are not permitted.  The purpose
of these limitations is to balance power against complexity of
implementation.  With the restrictions as they are, function
definitions could be implemented as textual substitutions---they
are simply macros.  Software implementations therefore do not need
the full function-definition machinery typically associated with
programming languages.


\subsubsection{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}

The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes have types \primtype{SId}
and \primtype{string}, respectively, and operate in the manner
described in Section~\ref{sec:idnameattribs}.  MathML \token{ci}
elements in an SBML model can refer to the function defined by a
\FunctionDefinition using the value of its \token{id} attribute.


\subsubsection{The \token{math} element}
\label{sec:function-definition-math}

The \token{math} element is a container for MathML content that
defines the function.  The content of this element can only be a
MathML \token{lambda} element or a MathML \token{semantics}
element containing a \token{lambda} element.  \FunctionDefinition
is the only place in SBML where a \token{lambda} element can be
used.  The \token{lambda} element must begin with zero or more
\token{bvar} elements, followed by any other of the elements in
the MathML subset listed in Section~\ref{sec:mathmlsubset}
\emph{except} \token{lambda} (\ie a \token{lambda} element cannot
contain another \token{lambda} element).

A further restriction on the content of \token{math} is that it
cannot contain references to variables other than the variables
declared to the \token{lambda} itself.  That is, the contents of
MathML \token{ci} elements inside the body of the \token{lambda}
can only be the variables declared by its \token{bvar} elements,
or the identifiers of other \FunctionDefinition{}s defined in
the same model.  This restriction also applies to the
  \token{csymbol} for \quantity{time}.  Functions must be written
so that all variables or parameters used in the MathML content are
passed to them via their function parameters.


\subsubsection{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}
\label{sec:functiondefinition-sboterm}

\FunctionDefinition inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a \FunctionDefinition instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type \FunctionDefinition 
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the function definition \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the function in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.




\subsubsection{Calling user-defined functions}
\label{sec:functiondefinition-calling}

Within MathML expressions in an SBML model, all calls to a
function defined by a \FunctionDefinition must use the same number
of arguments as specified in the function's definition.  The
number of arguments is equal to the number of \token{bvar}
elements inside the \token{lambda} element of the function
definition.

Note that \FunctionDefinition does not have a separate attribute
for defining the units of the value returned by the function.  The
units associated with the function's return value, when the
function is called from within MathML expressions elsewhere in
SBML, are simply the overall units of the expression in
\FunctionDefinition's \token{math} when applied to the arguments
supplied in the call to the function.


\subsubsection{Examples}

The following abbreviated SBML example shows a \FunctionDefinition
object instance defining \token{pow3} as the identifier of a function
computing the mathematical expression $x^{3}$, and after that, the
invocation of that function in the mathematical formula of a rate
law.  Note how the invocation of the function uses its identifier.

\begin{example}
<model ...>
    ...
    <listOfFunctionDefinitions>
        <functionDefinition id="pow3">
            <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
                  xmlns:sbml="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core">
                <lambda>
                    <bvar><ci> x </ci></bvar>
                    <apply>
                        <power/>
                        <ci> x </ci>
                        <cn sbml:units="dimensionless"> 3 </cn>
                    </apply>
                </lambda>
            </math>
        </functionDefinition>
    </listOfFunctionDefinitions>
    ...
    <listOfReactions>
        <reaction id="reaction_1" reversible="true" fast="false">
            ...
            <kineticLaw>
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                    <apply>
                        <ci> pow3 </ci>
                        <ci> S1 </ci>
                     </apply>
                </math>
            </kineticLaw>

\subsection{Unit definitions}
\label{sec:unitdefinitions}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Units of measurement may be supplied in a number of contexts in an
SBML model and associated with a variety of components.  The
overall units of any mathematical formula appearing in SBML are
those that arise naturally from the components and mathematical
expressions comprising the formula, or in other words, the units
obtained by doing dimensional analysis on the formula.

Rather than requiring a complete unit definition on every object,
SBML provides a facility for defining units that can be referenced
throughout a model.  The SBML unit definition facility uses two
classes of objects, \UnitDefinition and \Unit.  Their definitions
are shown in Figure~\vref{fig:unitdefinition} and explained in
more detail in Sections~\ref{sec:unitdefinition-structure}
and~\ref{sec:unit-structure} below.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.79]{figs/unitdefinition-uml}
  \caption{The definition of classes \UnitDefinition and
      \Unit.  A sequence of one or more instances of
      \UnitDefinition can be located in an instance of
      \ListOfUnitDefinitions in \Model
      (Figure~\protect\ref{fig:model}).  \class{ListOfUnits} has
      no attributes (beyond those it inherits from class \SBase);
      it merely acts as a container for one or more instances of
      \Unit objects.  Note that the only permitted values of
      \token{kind} on \Unit are the reserved words in
      Table~\vref{tab:unitkind}, but these symbols are
      \emph{excluded} from the permitted values of
      \UnitDefinition's \token{id} because SBML's unit system does
      not allow redefining the base units.}
  \label{fig:unitdefinition}
\end{figure}

The approach to defining units in SBML is compositional; for
example, $meter\ second^{\,-2}$ is constructed by combining a
\Unit object representing $meter$ with another \Unit object
representing $second^{\,-2}$.  The combination is wrapped inside a
\UnitDefinition, which provides for assigning an identifier and
optional name to the combination.  The identifier can then be
referenced from elsewhere in a model.

The vast majority of modeling situations requiring new SBML unit
definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base
units and factors.  An example of this might be ``moles per litre
per second''.  What distinguishes these sorts of simpler unit
definitions from more complex ones is that they may be expressed
without the use of an additive offset from a zero point.  The use
of offsets complicates all unit definition systems, yet in the
domain of SBML the real-life cases requiring offsets are few (and
in fact, to the best of our knowledge, only involve temperature).
Consequently, the SBML unit system has been consciously designed
in a way that attempts to simplify implementation of unit support
for the most common cases in systems biology, at the cost of
requiring units with offsets to be handled explicitly by the
modeler.  Section~\ref{sec:bp:unitdefinitions:offset} discusses
suggested approaches for handling situations requiring units with
offsets.


\subsubsection{\class{UnitDefinition}}
\label{sec:unitdefinition-structure}

A unit definition in SBML consists of an instance of a
\UnitDefinition object, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:unitdefinition}.


\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}

The required attribute \token{id} and optional attribute
\token{name} have data types \primtype{UnitSIdRef}
(Section~\ref{sec:unitsidref}) and \primtype{string},
respectively.  The \token{id} attribute is used to give the
defined unit a unique identifier by which other parts of the model
may refer to the unit.  The \token{name} attribute is intended to
be used for giving the unit definition an optional human-readable
name; see Section~\ref{sec:name} for more guidelines about the use
of names.

There is one important restriction about the use of unit
definition \token{id} values: the \token{id} of a \UnitDefinition
must \emph{not} contain a value from Table~\ref{tab:unitkind}, the
list of reserved base unit names.  This constraint simply prevents
the redefinition of base units.


\paragraph{The list of \class{Unit}s}
\label{sec:listofunits}

A \UnitDefinition object may contain a \ListOfUnits container which must
contain one or more \Unit objects. Section~\ref{sec:unit-structure} explains
the meaning and use of \Unit.   

\paragraph{Example}

The following skeleton of a unit definition illustrates an example
use of \UnitDefinition:

\begin{example}

<model ...>
    <listOfUnitDefinitions>
        <unitDefinition id="unit1">
            <listOfUnits>
                ...
            </listOfUnits>
        </unitDefinition>
        <unitDefinition id="unit2">
            <listOfUnits>
                ...
            </listOfUnits>
        </unitDefinition>
    </listOfUnitDefinitions>
    ...
</model>
\end{example}


\subsubsection{\class{Unit}}
\label{sec:unit-structure}

A \Unit object represents a (possibly transformed) reference to
a base unit chosen from the list in
  Table~\vref{tab:unitkind}.  The attribute
\token{kind} indicates the chosen base unit, whereas the
attributes \token{exponent}, \token{scale}, and
\token{multiplier} define how the base unit is being transformed.
These various attributes are described in detail below.


\paragraph{The \token{kind} attribute}

The \Unit attribute \token{kind} specifies a base unit to serve as
the starting point for a new unit definition.  The value of the
attribute must be taken from the list of reserved words given in
Table~\vref{tab:unitkind}.  These reserved symbols are defined in
the value space of the data type \primtype{UnitSId}
(Section~\ref{sec:unitsid}).

\begin{table}[bht]
  \centering
  \ttfamily
  \small
  \setlength{\arraycolsep}{8pt}
  \begin{edtable}{tabular}{@{}llllll@{}}
    \toprule
    ampere                    & farad            & joule    & lux      & radian    & volt  \\
    \underline{avogadro}      & gram             & katal    & metre    & second    & watt  \\
    becquerel                 & gray             & kelvin   & mole     & siemens   & weber \\
    candela                   & henry            & kilogram & newton   & sievert           \\

    \underline{dimensionless} & \underline{item} & lumen    & pascal   & tesla             \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{edtable}
  \caption{Base units defined in SBML.  These symbols are
    predefined values of type \primtype{UnitSId}
    (Section~\ref{sec:unitsid}).  All are names of base or derived
    SI units~\protect\citep{bipm:2006}, except for
    ``\token{avogadro}'', ``\token{dimensionless}'' and
    ``\token{item}'', which are SBML additions important for
    handling certain common situations.  The unit
    ``\token{avogadro}'' is the unit ``\token{dimensionless}''
    multiplied with Avogadro's number, the unit
    ``\token{dimensionless}'' is intended for cases where a
    quantity is a ratio whose units cancel out,
    and ``\token{item}'' is used for expressing such things as 
    ``N items'' (e.g., ``100 molecules'').  Also, note that the
    gram and litre are not strictly part of SI; however, they are
    frequently used in SBML's areas of application and therefore
    are included as predefined unit identifiers.  (The standard SI
    unit of mass is in fact the kilogram, and volume is defined in
    terms of cubic metres.)  Comparisons of these values, like all
    values of type \primtype{UnitSId}, must be performed in a
    case-sensitive manner.}
  \label{tab:unitkind}
\end{table}

Note that the set of acceptable values for the attribute \token{kind}
does \emph{not} include units defined by \UnitDefinition
objects.  This means that the units definition system
in SBML is not hierarchical: user-defined units cannot be built on
top of other user-defined units, only on top of base units.

The presence of \token{avogadro} in Table~\ref{tab:unitkind}
warrants an explanation.  The Bureau International des Poids et
Mesures specifically states, ``The mole is the amount of substance
of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there
are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon 12''---in other words, the
SI unit \token{mole} is technically \emph{a unit of measure for
  substance amount}.  Although people sometimes use ``mole''
loosely to refer to other things (\eg ``a mole of \emph{X}'' to
mean a number of \emph{X} equal to Avogadro's number, $6.022 \cdot
10^{23}$), such usage is not strictly correct.  We believe it is
even less correct in the context of reactions: although in SBML
they are called ``reactions'', there is nothing preventing the
SBML \Reaction construct from being used to represent other kinds
of processes not involving substances.  Consequently, we avoid
using \val{mole} loosely where substances may not be involved, and
instead use ``Avogadro's number of \emph{X}''.  In order to make
it easier for models to define units in these terms, the SBML unit
system includes the pseudo-unit \val{avogadro}, whose definition
is identical to the definition of the \emph{avogadro}
\token{csymbol} described in Section~\ref{sec:csymbol}.  The
numerical value is taken to be the one recommended by
CODATA~\citep{codata_2008}, but the unit is \token{dimensionless}.
In other words, it is defined as
\begin{linenomath}
  \begin{equation*}
    (6.02214179 \cdot 10^{23}) \cdot \texttt{dimensionless}
  \end{equation*}
\end{linenomath}
where the dot ($\cdot$) indicates simple scalar multiplication.
If the value of Avogadro's constant is revised by international
standards-setting organizations in the future, a future Version of
the SBML \thisL specification may stipulate a new value to be used
for \token{avogadro}.  However, all software reading models
expressed in \emph{this} Version of SBML Level~3 should
\emph{always} use the value of Avogadro's constant given above.

For purposes of comparing units, the following relationship should
be assumed:
\begin{linenomath}
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:unit-conversion-avogadro}
    \token{mole} = \token{avogadro} \cdot \token{item}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath}



\paragraph{The \token{exponent}, \token{scale} and
  \token{multiplier} attributes}
\label{sec:unit-structure:exponent}
\label{sec:unit-structure:scale}
\label{sec:unit-structure:multiplier}

\newcommand{\ynew}{\ensuremath{y}\xspace}
\newcommand{\ybase}{\ensuremath{y_b}\xspace}
\newcommand{\udef}{\ensuremath{\{u\}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\unew}{\ensuremath{\{u_\text{new}\}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\ubase}{\ensuremath{\{u_b\}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\ukind}{\ensuremath{\{u_\token{\,kind}\}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\uone}{\ensuremath{\{u_{b_1}\}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\utwo}{\ensuremath{\{u_{b_2}\}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\un}  {\ensuremath{\{u_{b_n}\}}\xspace}

The three other attributes \token{exponent}, \token{scale} and
\token{multiplier} work together to permit the use of \Unit for
expressing new units in terms of the base units listed in
Table~\vref{tab:unitkind}.  The formula underlying this definition
is the following:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
  \unew = (\token{multiplier} \cdot 10^\token{scale} \cdot \ukind)^\token{exponent}
\label{eq:unit-semantics}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
This formula defines a new unit, \unew, in terms of another unit,
\ukind.  The unit \ukind is one of the units listed in
Table~\ref{tab:unitkind}; in a given \Unit object, it is
chosen by setting the \token{kind} attribute.  Each of the other
components on the right-hand side of
Equation~\ref{eq:unit-semantics} correspond to the remaining
attributes in a \Unit object instance, and their meanings are as
follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item The \token{multiplier} attribute can be used to multiply the
  \token{kind} unit by a real-numbered factor.  This enables the
  definition of units that are not power-of-ten multiples of SI
  units.  For instance, a \token{multiplier} of 0.3048 could be
  used to define \val{foot} as a measure of length in terms of a
  \val{metre}.  A value of \token{multiplier} must always be
  provided in a \Unit object instance, but the value can be
  \val{1}.

\item The \token{scale} attribute can be used to set the exponent
  for a power-of-ten multiplier that rescales the unit.  For
  example, a unit having a \token{kind} value of \val{gram} and a
  \token{scale} value of \val{-3} signifies $10^{-3} \cdot gram$,
  or milligrams.  A value of \token{scale} must always be provided
  in a \Unit object instance; in those cases where a unit does not
  need to be scaled by a power of ten, the value of \token{scale}
  can be set to \val{0} (zero), because $10^0 = 1$.

\item The \token{exponent} attribute can be used to specify an
  overall exponent on the unit definition.  This provides a way to
  define units such as ``cubic meter'' in terms of the base unit
  \val{metre} (for which an \token{exponent} value of~\val{3}
  would be appropriate).  A value of \token{exponent} must always
  be provided in a \Unit object instance.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Semantics and use of \Unit and \UnitDefinition}
\label{sec:unit-structure:semantics}

A single \Unit object instance takes one of the base units from
Table~\ref{tab:unitkind} and specifies how it should be
transformed.  A \UnitDefinition object instance combines one or
more \Unit objects to define a new, composed unit, \udef.  The new
unit \udef created by a \UnitDefinition is defined as the product
of all the \Unit objects contained in the \ListOfUnits within the
\UnitDefinition object instance.  More formally, 
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
  \udef = \{u_1\} \, \cdot \, \{u_2\} \, \cdot \ldots \cdot \, \{u_n\} 
\label{eq:unitDefinition-semantics}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
where the $\{u_i\}$'s are individual \Unit definitions as defined
by Equation~\ref{eq:unit-semantics}.  Now, let the value of the
\token{multiplier} attribute of a given unit $\{u_i\}$ be
represented by the variable $m_i$.  Similarly, let the value of
the \token{scale} attribute be represented by $s_i$, and the value
of the \token{exponent} attribute be represented by $x_i$.
Equation~\ref{eq:unitDefinition-semantics} can be rewritten in
expanded form as
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{align}
  \{u\} &= (m_1 \cdot 10^{s_1} \cdot \uone)^{x_1} \cdot
           (m_2 \cdot 10^{s_2} \cdot \utwo)^{x_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot (m_n \cdot
           10^{s_n} \cdot \un)^{x_n} \notag \\[2pt]
        &= m_1^{x_1} \cdot m_2^{x_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot m_n^{x_n}
           \cdot 10^{(s_1 x_1 + s_2 x_2 + \ldots + s_n x_n)}
           \cdot \uone^{x_1} \cdot \utwo^{x_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot \un^{x_n} \notag \\[2pt]
        &= m \cdot 10^{s} \cdot \uone^{x_1} \cdot \utwo^{x_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot \un^{x_n}
\label{eq:multip-units}
\end{align}
\end{linenomath}
where the terms $m$ and $s$ in the last line
(Equation~\ref{eq:multip-units}) are defined as
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{align*}
  m &= m_1^{x_1} \cdot m_2^{x_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot m_n^{x_n} \\
  s &= s_1 x_1 + s_2 x_2 + \ldots + s_n x_n
\end{align*}
\end{linenomath}
Equation~\ref{eq:multip-units} expresses how a \UnitDefinition
object instance combines multiple \Unit object instances to
produce a new unit definition in an SBML model.


\paragraph{Examples}

As a concrete example to illustrate the definitions above, let us
define a unit for \val{foot} in terms of the base unit
\val{metre}.  This requires using \token{multiplier}=\val{0.3048},
\token{scale}=\val{0}, and \token{exponent}=\val{1}:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{align*}
  \text{foot} = 0.3048 \cdot 10^0 \cdot \token{metre}
\end{align*}
\end{linenomath}
The following fragment of SBML illustrates how this could be
represented in XML:
\begin{example}
<listOfUnitDefinitions>
    <unitDefinition id="foot">
        <listOfUnits>
            <unit kind="metre" multiplier="0.3048" scale="0" exponent="1"/>
        </listOfUnits>
    </unitDefinition>
</listOfUnitDefinitions>
\end{example}
To give another example, the following illustrates the definition
of an abbreviation \val{mmls} for the units $millimoles\ l^{-1}\
s^{-1}$:

\begin{example}
<listOfUnitDefinitions>
    <unitDefinition id="mmls">
        <listOfUnits>
            <unit kind="mole"   exponent="1"  scale="-3" multiplier="1"/>
            <unit kind="litre"  exponent="-1" scale="0"  multiplier="1"/>
            <unit kind="second" exponent="-1" scale="0"  multiplier="1"/>
        </listOfUnits>
    </unitDefinition>
</listOfUnitDefinitions>
\end{example}


\paragraph{Comparing and/or converting units in a model}

The unit system in SBML allows model quantities to be expressed in
units other than the base units of Table~\ref{tab:unitkind}.  For
analyses and computations, the consumer of the model (be it a
software tool or a human) will want to convert all model
quantities to base SI units for purposes such as verifying the
consistency of units throughout the model.  To understand this
process in the context of SBML's unit system, let us consider how
we would convert a quantity \ybase, measured in base units, to a
new quantity \ynew, measured in alternative units \udef.  The
relationship between the two quantities will be given by
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
  \ybase \cdot \uone^{z_1} \cdot \utwo^{z_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot \un^{z_n} = \ynew  \cdot \udef 
\label{eq:unit-equality}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
where the unkown exponents of the base units are denoted with
$z_i$.  Substituting Equation~\ref{eq:multip-units} for \udef into
Equation~\ref{eq:unit-equality} above results in the following
expression:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
  \ybase \cdot \uone^{z_1} \cdot \utwo^{z_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot \un^{z_n}
    = \ynew \cdot m \cdot 10^s \cdot \uone^{x_1} \cdot \utwo^{x_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot \un^{x_n}
\label{eq:unit-conversion}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
Since the base units are independent, the equation above can be
solved for the unknown exponents on the left-hand side:
$z_i = x_i$ and $\ybase = \ynew \cdot m \cdot 10^s$.

\label{sec:unit-simple-approach}
Some additional points are worth discussing about the unit scheme.
First, and most importantly, the equations
above are formulated with the assumption that the base units do
not require an additive offset as part of their definition.
\emph{When temperature values in units other than kelvin are being
  considered, then a different interpretation must be made}, as
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bp:unitdefinitions:offset}.

A second point is that care is needed to avoid seemingly-obvious
but incorrect translations into this scheme of units taken from
textbooks.  The scheme above makes it easy to formulate statements
such as ``1 foot = 0.3048 metres'' in the most natural way.
However, the most common expression of the relationship between
temperature in Fahrenheit and kelvin, ``$T_{Fahrenheit} = 1.8
\cdot (T_{kelvin} - 273.15) + 32$'' might lead one to believe that
defining Fahrenheit degrees in terms of kelvin degrees involves
using \token{multiplier}=\val{1.8}.  \emph{Not so}, when degree
changes are being considered and not temperature values.
Converting \emph{temperature values} is different from expressing
a relationship between degree measurements.  The proper value for
the multiplier in the latter case is $5/9$, \ie
\token{multiplier}=\val{0.555556} (where we picked an arbitrary
decimal precision).  If, on the other hand, the actual temperature
is relevant to a quantity (\eg if a model uses a quantity that has
particular values at particular temperatures), then offsets are
required in the unit calculations.  While the SBML unit system
does not allow a means of specifying offsets directly, it is still
possible to encode models using such units.
Section~\ref{sec:bp:unitdefinitions:offset} provides suggestions
for possible ways of handling such cases.


\subsubsection{References to units}

An attribute that defines the units of a mathematical entity (\eg the
attribute \token{units} on \Parameter) can refer to a defined unit
whose identifier is chosen from among the following:
\begin{itemize}
  
\item The base units listed in Table~\vref{tab:unitkind}; and

\item A new unit identifier defined by a \UnitDefinition as
  described in Section~\ref{sec:unitdefinitions}.

\end{itemize}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Compartments}
\label{sec:compartments}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A \emph{compartment} in SBML represents a bounded space in which
species are located.  Compartments do not necessarily have to
correspond to actual structures inside or outside of a biological
system, although models are often designed that way.  The definition
of \Compartment is shown in Figure~\vref{fig:compartment}.

  \caption{The definition of class \Compartment.  A
      sequence of one or more instances of \Compartment objects
      can be located in an instance of \ListOfCompartments in
      \Model, as shown in Figure~\protect\ref{fig:model}.}
  \label{fig:compartment}
\end{figure}

It is important to note that although compartments are optional in
the overall definition of \Model (see Section~\ref{sec:model}),
every species in an SBML model must be located in a compartment.
This in turn means that if a model defines any species, the model
must also define at least one compartment.  The reason is simply
that species represent physical things, and therefore must exist
\emph{somewhere}.  Compartments represent the \emph{somewhere}.


\subsubsection{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}

\Compartment has one required attribute, \token{id}, of type
\primtype{SId}, to give the compartment a unique identifier by
which other parts of an SBML model definition can refer to it.  A
compartment can also have an optional \token{name} attribute of type
\primtype{string}.  Identifiers and names must be used according
to the guidelines described in Section~\ref{sec:idnameattribs}.


\subsubsection{The \token{spatialDimensions} attribute}
\label{sec:compartment-spatialdimensions}

A \Compartment object has an optional floating-point attribute
named \token{spatialDimensions} whose value indicates the number
of spatial dimensions possessed by the compartment.  Most modeling
scenarios involve compartments with integer values of
\token{spatialDimensions}=\val{3} (\ie a three-dimensional
compartment, which is to say, a volume),
\token{spatialDimensions}=\val{2} (\ie a two-dimensional
compartment, a surface), or \token{spatialDimensions}=\val{1} (\ie
a one-dimensional compartment, which is to say, a line).  However,
SBML \thisL does not restrict compartments'
\token{spatialDimensions} values, in order to allow for the
possibility of representing structures with fractal dimensions.

In SBML \thisLV, the number of spatial dimensions possessed by a
compartment cannot enter into mathematical formulas, and therefore
cannot alter the numerical interpretation of a model.  However,
the value of \token{spatialDimensions} does affect the
interpretation of the units associated with a compartment's
\token{size} value.  Specifically, the value of
\token{spatialDimensions} is used to select among the \Model
attributes \token{volumeUnits}, \token{areaUnits} and
\token{lengthUnits} when a \Compartment object does not define a
value for its \token{units} attribute.  This is described in more
detail below in Section~\ref{sec:compartment-units}.


\subsubsection{The \token{size} attribute}
\label{sec:compartment-size}
\label{sec:size}

The optional \Compartment attribute \token{size}, with a data type
of \primtype{double}, can be used to set the initial size of the
compartment.  The size may correspond to a volume (if the
compartment is a three-dimensional one), or it may be an area (if
the compartment is two-dimensional), or a length (if the
compartment is one-dimensional).

A compartment's size is set by its \token{size} attribute exactly
once.  If the compartment's \token{constant} attribute value is
\val{true}, then the size is fixed and cannot be changed except by
an \InitialAssignment in the model.  The approach of using an
\InitialAssignment differs from setting the \token{size} attribute
in that \token{size} can only be used to set the compartment size
to a literal scalar value, whereas \InitialAssignment allows the
value to be set using an arbitrary mathematical expression.  If
the compartment's \token{constant} attribute is \val{false}, the
size value may be overridden by an \InitialAssignment or changed
by an \AssignmentRule or \AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for
simulation time $t > 0$, it may also be changed by a \RateRule or
\Event{}s.  (However, some constructs are mutually exclusive; see
Sections~\ref{sec:rules} and~\ref{sec:events}.)  It is not an
error to set the value of \token{size} on a compartment and also
redefine the value using an \InitialAssignment, but the original
\token{size} value in that case is ignored.
Section~\ref{sec:before-t0} provides additional information about
the semantics of assignments, rules and values for simulation time
$t \leq 0$.

It is important to note that in SBML Level~3, a missing
\token{size} value \emph{does not imply that the compartment size
  is~\val{1}}.  A missing value for \token{size} for a given
compartment signifies that the value either is unknown, or to be
obtained from an external source, or determined by an initial
assignment (Section~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}) or other SBML
construct elsewhere in the model.  Further, due to the fact that
alternative methods available for setting the size of a
compartment, the \token{size} attribute must be defined as
optional; however, \emph{it is good practice to specify a value
  the size of every compartment in a model}, no matter what method
is used, when compartment size values are available.  The reasons
for this are explained in Section~\ref{sec:bp:size}.


\subsubsection{The \token{units} attribute}
\label{sec:compartment-units}

The units associated with the compartment's \token{size} value may
be set using the optional \Compartment attribute \token{units}.
The attribute's value must have the data type \primtype{UnitSIdRef}
(Section~\ref{sec:unitsidref}).

The \token{units} attribute may be left unspecified for a given
compartment in a model; in that case, the compartment inherits the
units defined by one of the attributes on the enclosing \Model
object instance.  The applicable attribute on \Model depends on
the value of the compartment's \token{spatialDimensions}
attribute; the relationship is shown in
Table~\vref{tab:comp-size-units}.  If the \Model object does not
define the relevant attribute (\token{volumeUnits},
\token{areaUnits} or \token{lengthUnits}) for a given
\token{spatialDimensions} value, the units associated with that
\Compartment object's size are undefined.   If \emph{both}
\token{spatialDimensions} and \token{units} are left unset on a
given \Compartment object instance, then no units can be chosen
from among the \Model's \token{volumeUnits}, \token{areaUnits} or
\token{lengthUnits} attributes (even if the \Model instance
provides values for those attributes), because there is no basis to
select between them and there is no default value of
\token{spatialDimensions}.  Leaving the units of compartment sizes
undefined in an SBML model does not render the model invalid;
however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that
all models specify the units of measurement for every compartment
size.  A list of recommended units is given in
Section~\ref{sec:bp:unitdefinitions:recommendedunits}.
  
\begin{table}[tbh]
  \small
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cll}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Value of attribute} & \textbf{Attribute of} \class{Model} \textbf{used} \\[-2pt]
    \token{spatialDimensions}  & \textbf{for inheriting units of size} & \textbf{Allowable kinds of units}\\
    \midrule
    \val{3} & \token{volumeUnits} 	& units of volume, or \token{dimensionless}\\
    \val{2} & \token{areaUnits} 	& units of area, or \token{dimensionless}\\
    \val{1} & \token{lengthUnits} 	& units of length, or \token{dimensionless}\\
    other   & \emph{no units inherited} & \emph{no restrictions}\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{When a \Compartment object instance does not specify a
    value for the \token{units} attribute, the units associated
    with the compartment's size are inherited from
    the enclosing \Model instance according to the rules above.
    The left-hand column indicates the value of the compartment's
    \token{spatialDimensions} attribute, and the middle column
    indicates the \Model attribute whose value should be used in
    that case.  The right-hand column lists the types of units
    allowed in each case; the restrictions allow software tools
    to perform validation on the most common situations.}
  \label{tab:comp-size-units}
\end{table}

The units of the compartment size, as defined by the \token{units}
attribute or (if \token{units} is not set) the inherited value from
\Model according to Table~\vref{tab:comp-size-units}, are used in
the following ways:
\begin{itemize}

\item The value of the \token{units} attribute is used
  as the units of the compartment identifier when the identifier
  appears as a numerical quantity in a mathematical formula
  expressed in MathML (discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ci-token}).

\item When a \Species is to be treated in terms of concentrations
  or density, the units of the spatial size portion of the
  concentration value (\ie the denominator in the units formula
  \quantity{amount}/\quantity{size}) are those indicated by the
  value of the \token{units} attribute on the compartment in which
  the species is located.

\item The \token{math} element of an \AssignmentRule or
  \InitialAssignment referring to this compartment should have
  identical units (see Sections~\ref{sec:assignmentrule}
  and~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}).

\item In \RateRule objects that set the rate of change of the
  compartment's size (Section~\ref{sec:raterule}), the units of
  the rule's \token{math} element should be identical to the
  compartment's \token{units} attribute divided by the model-wide
  \quantity{time} units.  (In other words, the units for the rate
  of change of compartment size are \quantity{compartment
    size}/\quantity{time} units.)

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{The \token{constant} attribute}
\label{sec:compartment-constant}

A \Compartment also has a mandatory boolean attribute called
\token{constant} that indicates whether the compartment's size
stays constant or can vary during a simulation.  A value of
\val{false} indicates the compartment's \token{size} can be
changed by other constructs in SBML.  A value of \val{true}
indicates the compartment's \token{size} cannot be changed by any
construct except \InitialAssignment.  Section~\ref{sec:size}
provides more information.


\subsubsection{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}
\label{sec:compartment-sboterm}

\Compartment inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a \Compartment instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type \Compartment 
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the compartment  \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the compartment in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{Examples}

The following example illustrates two compartments in an
abbreviated SBML example of a model definition.  The compartment
definitions do not set their \token{units} attribute, so both of
these compartments inherit units of size (\token{litre}) from
\token{model}.

\begin{example}
<model volumeUnits="litre" ...>
    ...
    <listOfCompartments>
        <compartment id="cytosol" size="2.5" constant="true" spatialDimensions="3"/>
        <compartment id="mitochondria" size="0.3" constant="true" spatialDimensions="3"/>
    </listOfCompartments>
    ...
</model>
\end{example}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Species}
\label{sec:species}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A \emph{species} in SBML refers to a pool of entities that (a) are
considered indistinguishable from each other for the purposes of
the model, (b) participate in reactions, and (c) are located in a
specific \emph{compartment}.  The SBML \Species object class is
intended to represent these pools.  Its definition is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:species}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \vspace*{1ex}

  \small
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[above=1.05in] (a) {
      \emptyClassbox{\textsl{SBase}}

        id: SId                                                             \\

    instances of \Species objects can be located in an instance of

    Figure~\protect\ref{fig:model}.}
  \label{fig:species}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}

As with other major objects in SBML, \Species has a mandatory
attribute, \token{id}, used to give the species an identifier.  The
identifier must be a text string conforming to the syntax
permitted by the \primtype{SId} data type described in
Section~\ref{sec:sid}.  \Species also has an optional \token{name}
attribute, of type \primtype{string}.  The \token{name} and \token{id}
attributes must be used as described in
Section~\ref{sec:idnameattribs}.


\subsubsection{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}
\label{sec:species-sboterm}

\Species inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a \Species instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type \Species 
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the species \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the species in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{The \token{compartment} attribute}
\label{sec:species-compartment}

The required attribute \token{compartment}, of type
\primtype{SIdRef}, is used to identify the compartment in which
the species is located.  The attribute's value must be the
identifier of an existing \Compartment object in the model.  Note
that SBML does not have a concept of a default compartment---every
species in an SBML model must be assigned a compartment
\emph{explicitly}, by setting the value of the \token{compartment}
attribute.  (This also implies that every model with one or more
\Species objects must define at least one \Compartment object.)


\subsubsection{The \token{initialAmount},
  \token{initialConcentration}, and \token{substanceUnits} attributes}
\label{sec:initialAmount}
\label{sec:species-substanceunits}

The optional attributes \token{initialAmount} and
\token{initialConcentration}, both having a data type of
\primtype{double}, can be used to set the initial quantity of the
species in the compartment where the species is located.  These
two attributes are mutually exclusive---either one can be used,
but \emph{only one} can have a value on any given instance of a
\Species object.  Missing \token{initialAmount} and
\token{initialConcentration} values implies that their values
either are unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or
determined by an initial assignment
(Section~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}) or other SBML construct
elsewhere in the model.

A species' initial quantity is set by the \token{initialAmount} or
\token{initialConcentration} attributes exactly once.
If the \token{constant} attribute is \val{true},
then the value of the species' quantity
is fixed and cannot be changed except
by an \InitialAssignment.  These methods differ in that the
\token{initialAmount} and \token{initialConcentration}
attributes can only be used to set the species quantity
to a literal scalar value, whereas \InitialAssignment allows the
value to be set using an arbitrary mathematical expression.  If
the species' \token{constant} attribute is \val{false},
the species' quantity value may be overridden by an
\InitialAssignment or changed by \AssignmentRule or
\AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for $t > 0$, it may also be
changed by a \RateRule, \Event{}s, and as a result of being a
reactant or product in one or more \Reaction{}s. 
(However, some constructs are
mutually exclusive; see Sections~\ref{sec:rules}
and~\ref{sec:events}.)  It is not an error to define
\token{initialAmount} or \token{initialConcentration} on a species
and also redefine the value using an \InitialAssignment, but the
\token{initialAmount} or \token{initialConcentration} setting in
that case is ignored.  Section~\ref{sec:before-t0} provides
additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules
and values for simulation time $t \leq 0$.

When the \token{initialAmount} attribute is set, the units
associated with its value are specified by the \Species attribute
\token{substanceUnits}, whose value must have the data type
\primtype{UnitSIdRef} (Section~\ref{sec:unitsidref}).  When the
\token{initialConcentration} attribute is set, the units
associated with its value are \quantity{amount}/\quantity{size}
units, where the units of \quantity{amount} are those
specified by the \token{substanceUnits} attribute, and the
\quantity{size} units are those associated with the definition of
the size of the \Compartment in which the species is located.
Note that in either case, \quantity{amount} units are
involved and determined by the \token{substanceUnits} attribute.
If the \token{substanceUnits} attribute is not set on a given
\Species object instance, then the value for that species is
inherited from the \token{substanceUnits} attribute on the
enclosing \Model object instance.  If that attribute on \Model is
not set either, then the units of the species' quantity are
undefined.  Leaving the units of species quantities undefined in
an SBML model does not render the model invalid; however, as a
matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that all models
specify the units of measurement for every species quantity.  A
list of recommended units is given in
Section~\ref{sec:bp:unitdefinitions:recommendedunits}.

Setting \token{initialAmount} or \token{initialConcentration} does
\emph{not} determine whether a species identifier represents an
amount or a concentration when it appears elsewhere in an SBML
model.  Instead, that aspect is something controlled by the
attribute \token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits}, discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:species-units} below.


\subsubsection{The \token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits} attribute and the
  units of the species}
\label{sec:species-units}

When the identifier of a species appears in a mathematical
expression or as the subject of SBML rules, initial assignments or
event assignments, the identifier may represent either a
concentration value or an amount value.  The \primtype{boolean}
attribute \token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits} determines which
interpretation applies for a given \Species object instance.  The
interpretation rule is the following.  The \emph{units of the
  species} are of the form \quantity{amount}/\quantity{size} units
(\ie \quantity{concentration} units, using a broad definition of
concentration) if \token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits} has the value
\val{false}.  Otherwise, if \token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits} has the
value \val{true}, then the \emph{units of the species} are of the
form \quantity{amount}.

Although it may seem as though this intention could be determined
based on whether \token{initialConcentration} or
\token{initialAmount} is set, the fact that these two \Species
attributes are optional means that a separate flag is needed.
(Consider the situation where neither is set, and instead the
species' quantity is established by an \InitialAssignment or
\AssignmentRule.)

% FIXME this should be a best practice:
%
% As an aside, we note that treating species in terms of
% \quantity{substance} units (\ie discrete quantities such as
% molecule counts) rather than concentrations is common when using
% discrete stochastic simulation
% frameworks~\citep{gillespie:1977,wilkinson_2006}.  The appropriate
% way of accomplishing this in SBML is to set
% \token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits}=\val{true} in the species'
% definitions.

The \emph{units of the species} are used in the following ways in
SBML:
\begin{itemize}

\item The species identifier has these units when the
    identifier appears as a numerical quantity in a mathematical
  formula expressed in MathML (discussed in
  Section~\ref{sec:ci-token}).

\item The \token{math} element of an \AssignmentRule or
  \InitialAssignment referring to this species should have identical
  units (see Sections~\ref{sec:assignmentrule}
  and~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}).

\item In \RateRule objects that set the rate of change of the
  species' quantity (Section~\ref{sec:raterule}), the units of the
  rule's \token{math} element should be identical to the
  \quantity{units of the species} divided by the model's
  \quantity{time} units.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{The \token{constant} and \token{boundaryCondition} attributes}
\label{sec:species-constant}

The \Species object has two other mandatory boolean attributes
named \token{constant} and \token{boundaryCondition}, used to
indicate whether and how the quantity of that species can vary
during a simulation.  Table~\ref{tab:specieattrib} shows how to
interpret the combined values of the \token{boundaryCondition} and
\token{constant} attributes.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \vspace*{2ex}
  \centering
  \small
  \begin{edtable}{tabular}{lllll}
    \toprule
                              &                                    & \textbf{can have}     & \textbf{can be} \\
    \textbf{\token{constant}} & \textbf{\token{boundaryCondition}} & \textbf{assignment}   & \textbf{reactant or} & \textbf{species' quantity} \\
    \textbf{value}            & \textbf{value}                     & \textbf{or rate rule} & \textbf{product}   & \textbf{can be changed by} \\
    \midrule
    true & true & no & yes & (never changes)\\
    false & true & yes & yes & rules and events \\
    true & false & no & no & (never changes) \\
    false & false & yes & yes & reactions \emph{or} rules (but not both), and events \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{edtable}
  \caption{How to interpret the values of the \token{constant} and
      \token{boundaryCondition} attributes on \Species.
      Note that column four is specifically about reactants and
      products and \emph{not} also about species acting as
      modifiers; the latter are by definition unchanged by reactions.}
  \label{tab:specieattrib}
\end{table}

When a species is a product or reactant of one or more
reactions, its quantity is determined by those reactions.  In
SBML, it is possible to indicate that a given species' quantity is
\emph{not} determined by the set of reactions even when that
species occurs as a product or reactant; \ie the species is on the
\emph{boundary} of the reaction system, and its quantity is not
determined by the reactions.  The boolean attribute
\token{boundaryCondition} with value \val{true} can be used to indicate 
this.  A value of \val{false} indicates that the species
\emph{is} part of the reaction system.

The \token{constant} attribute indicates whether the species'
quantity can be changed at all, regardless of whether by
reactions, rules, or constructs other than \InitialAssignment.  A
value of \val{false} indicates that the species' quantity can be
changed.  This is the most common situation because the purpose of
many models is precisely to calculate changes in species
quantities over time.  Note that the initial quantity of a species
can be set by an \InitialAssignment irrespective of the value of
the \token{constant} attribute.

In practice, a \token{boundaryCondition} value of \val{true} means
a differential equation derived from the reaction definitions
should not be generated for the species.  However, the species'
quantity may still be changed by \AssignmentRule, \RateRule,
\AlgebraicRule, \Event, and \InitialAssignment constructs if its
\token{constant} attribute is \val{false}.  Conversely, if the
species' \token{constant} attribute is \val{true}, then its value
cannot be changed by anything except \InitialAssignment.

A species having \token{boundaryCondition}=\val{false} and
\token{constant}=\val{false} can appear as a product and/or
reactant of one or more reactions in the model.  If the species is
a reactant or product of a reaction, it must not also appear as
the target of any \AssignmentRule or \RateRule object in the
model.  If instead the species has
\token{boundaryCondition}=\val{false} and
\token{constant}=\val{true}, then it cannot appear as a reactant
or product, or as the target of any \AssignmentRule, \RateRule or
\EventAssignment object in the model.

The example model in section~\ref{sec:constantspecieseg} contains
all four possible combinations of the \token{boundaryCondition}
and \token{constant} attributes on \token{species} elements.
Section~\ref{sec:odeeg} gives an example of how one can translate
into ODEs a model that uses \token{boundaryCondition} and
\token{constant} attributes.


\subsubsection{The \token{conversionFactor} attribute}
\label{sec:species-conversion}

The attribute \token{conversionFactor} defines a conversion factor
that applies to a particular species.  The value of the attribute
must have the data type \primtype{SIdRef} and must be the
identifier of a \Parameter object instance defined in the model.
That \Parameter object must be a constant, meaning its
\token{constant} attribute must be set to \val{true}.  If a given
\Species object definition defines a value for its
\token{conversionFactor} attribute, it takes precedence over any
factor defined by the \Model object's \token{conversionFactor}
attribute.

In SBML, the units of species can be different from the units of
extent of reactions in the model; thus, when calculating how a
reaction affects a species, unit conversions may need to be
applied.  The use of a conversion factor in computing the effects
of reactions on a species' quantity is explained in
Section~\ref{sec:constructing-equations}.  Because the value of
the \token{conversionFactor} attribute is the identifier of a
\Parameter object in the model, and because parameters can have
units attached to them, the transformation from reaction extent
units to species units can be completely specified using this
approach.

Note that the unit conversion factor is only applied when
calculating the effect of a reaction on a species.  It is not used
in any rules or other SBML constructs that affect the species, and
it is also not used when the value of the species is referenced in
a mathematical expression.


\subsubsection{Additional considerations for interpreting the
  numerical value of a species}
\label{sec:species-meaning}

Species are unique in SBML in that they have a kind of duality: a
species identifier may stand for either substance amount (meaning,
a count of the number of individual entities) or a concentration
or density (meaning, amount divided by a compartment size).  The
previous sections explain the meaning of a species identifier when
it is referenced in a mathematical formula or in rules or other
SBML constructs; however, it remains to specify what happens to a
species when the compartment in which it is located changes in
size.

When a species definition has the attribute value
\token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits}=\val{false} and the size of the
compartment in which the species is located changes, the default
in SBML is to assume that it is the concentration that must be
updated to account for the size change.  This follows from the
principle that, all other things held constant, if a compartment
simply changes in size, the size change does not in itself cause
an increase or decrease in the number of entities of any species
in that compartment.  In a sense, the default is that the amount
of a species is preserved across compartment size changes.  Upon
such size changes, the value of the concentration or density must
be recalculated from the simple relationship \emph{concentration}
= \emph{amount}/\emph{size} if the value of the concentration is
needed (for example, if the species identifier appears in a
mathematical formula or is otherwise referenced in an SBML
construct).  There is one exception: if the species' quantity is
determined by an \AssignmentRule, \RateRule, \AlgebraicRule, or an
\EventAssignment and the species has the attribute value
\token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits}=\val{false}, it means that the
\emph{concentration} is assigned by the rule or event; in that
case, the \emph{amount} must be be calculated when the compartment
size changes.  (Events also require additional care in this
situation, because an event with multiple assignments could
conceivably reassign both a species quantity and a compartment
size simultaneously.  Section~\ref{sec:eventassignment} describes
the handling of species in event assignments.)

Note that the above only matters if a species has the attribute
\token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits}=\val{false}, meaning that the
species identifier refers to a concentration wherever the
identifier appears in a mathematical formula.  If instead the
attribute's value is \val{true}, then the identifier of the
species \emph{always} stands for an amount wherever it appears in
a mathematical formula or is referenced by an SBML construct.  In
that case, there is never a question about whether an assignment
or event is meant to affect the amount or concentration: it is
always the amount.

A particularly confusing situation occurs when the species has
attribute \token{constant}=\val{true}.  Suppose that such a
species is defined with \token{hasOnlySubstanceUnits}=\val{false}
and is given a value for \token{initialConcentration}.  Does
\token{constant}=\val{true} mean that the concentration is held
constant if the compartment size changes?  No; it is still the
amount that is kept constant across a compartment size change.
The fact that the species was initialized using a concentration
value is irrelevant.


\subsubsection{Example}

The following example shows two species definitions within an
abbreviated SBML model definition.  The example shows that species
are listed under the heading \token{listOfSpecies} in the model:

\begin{example}
<model ...>
    ...
    <listOfSpecies>
        <species id="Glucose" compartment="cell" initialConcentration="4"
                 hasOnlySubstanceUnits="false" boundaryCondition="false" 
                 constant="false"/>
        <species id="Glucose_6_P" compartment="cell" initialConcentration="0.75"
                 hasOnlySubstanceUnits="false" boundaryCondition="false" 
                 constant="false"/>
    </listOfSpecies>
    ...
</model>
\end{example}

\subsection{Parameters}
\label{sec:parameters}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A \Parameter is used in SBML to define a symbol associated with a
value; this symbol can then be used in mathematical formulas in a
model. The definition of
\Parameter is shown in Figure~\vref{fig:parameter}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \small
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[above=0.6in] (a) {
      \emptyClassbox{\textsl{SBase}}
    };
    \node (b) {
      \begin{classbox}{\textcolor{black}{Parameter}}
        id: SId                                               \\
        name: string \{ use="optional" \}                     \\
        value: double \{ use="optional" \}                    \\
        units: UnitSIdRef \{ use="optional" \}     \\
        constant: boolean \\
      \end{classbox}
    };
    \draw[open triangle 60-] (a) -- (b);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The definition of class \Parameter.  A
      sequence of one or more instances of \Parameter objects can
      be located in an instance of \ListOfParameters in \Model, as
      shown in Figure~\protect\ref{fig:model}.}
  \label{fig:parameter}
\end{figure}

The use of the term \emph{parameter} in SBML sometimes leads to
confusion among readers who have a particular notion of what
something called ``parameter'' should be.  It has been the source
of heated debate, but despite this, no one has yet found an
adequate replacement term that does not have different
connotations to different people and hence leads to confusion
among \emph{some} subset of users.  Perhaps it would have been
better to have two constructs, one called ``constants'' and the
other called ``variables''.  The current approach in SBML is
simply more parsimonious, using a single \Parameter construct with
the boolean flag \token{constant} to indicate which flavor the
parameter is.  In any case, readers are implored to look past
their particular definition of a ``parameter'' and simply view
SBML's \Parameter as a single mechanism for defining both
constants and (additional) variables in a model.  (We write
\emph{additional} because the species in a model are usually
considered to be the central variables.)  After all, software
tools are not required to expose to users the actual names of
particular SBML constructs, and thus tools can present to their
users whatever terms their designers feel best matches their
target audience.


\subsubsection{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}

\Parameter has one required attribute, \token{id}, of type
\primtype{SId}, to give the parameter a unique identifier by which
other parts of an SBML model definition can refer to it.  A
parameter can also have an optional \token{name} attribute of type
\primtype{string}.  Identifiers and names must be used according
to the guidelines described in Section~\ref{sec:idnameattribs}.


\subsubsection{The \token{value} attribute}
\label{sec:parameter-value}

The optional attribute \token{value} determines the value (of type
\primtype{double}) assigned to the identifier.  A missing
\token{value} implies that the \token{value} either is unknown, or
to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an
initial assignment (Section~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}) or 
other SBML construct elsewhere in the model.

A parameter's value is set by its \token{value} attribute exactly
once.  If the parameter's \token{constant} attribute
(Section~\ref{sec:parameter-constant}) has the value \val{true},
then the value is fixed and cannot be changed except by an
\InitialAssignment.  These two methods of setting the parameter's
value differ in that the \token{value} attribute can only be used
to set it to a literal scalar value, whereas \InitialAssignment
allows the value to be set using an arbitrary mathematical
expression.  If the parameter's \token{constant} attribute has the
value \val{false}, the parameter's value may be overridden by an
\InitialAssignment or changed by \AssignmentRule or
\AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for simulation time $t > 0$, it
may also be changed by a \RateRule or \Event{}s.  (However, some
of these constructs are mutually exclusive; see
Sections~\ref{sec:rules} and~\ref{sec:events}.)  It is not an
error to define \token{value} on a parameter and also redefine the
value using an \InitialAssignment, but the \token{value} in that
case is ignored.  Section~\ref{sec:before-t0} provides additional
information about the semantics of assignments, rules and values
for simulation time $t \leq 0$.


\subsubsection{The \token{units} attribute}
\label{sec:parameter-units}

The units associated with the value of the parameter can be
specified by the optional attribute \token{units}.  The
attribute's value must have the data type \primtype{UnitSIdRef}
(Section~\ref{sec:unitsidref}).  There are no constraints on the
units that can be assigned to a parameter; there are also no units
to inherit from the enclosing \Model object (unlike the case for,
e.g., \Species and \Compartment).

The units of the parameter are used in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}

\item When the parameter identifier appears in mathematical
  formulas expressed in MathML in a model, the units associated
  with the value are those declared by the parameter's
  \token{units} attribute.

\item The units of the \token{math} element of an \AssignmentRule,
  \InitialAssignment or \EventAssignment setting the value of the
  parameter should be identical to the units declared by the
  parameter's \token{units} attribute.

\item The units of the \token{math} element of a \RateRule that
  references the parameter should be identical to \quantity{parameter
    units}/\quantity{time}, where \quantity{parameter units} are
  the units declared for the parameter using the \token{units}
  attribute and \quantity{time} is the model-wide \token{time}
  units.

\end{itemize}

The fact that the \token{units} attribute value is optional means
that models can define parameters with undeclared units.  Leaving
the units of parameter values undefined in an SBML model does not
render the model invalid; however, as mentioned elsewhere, as a
matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that all models
specify the units of measurement for every parameter.


\subsubsection{The \token{constant} attribute}
\label{sec:parameter-constant}

The \Parameter object has a mandatory boolean attribute named
\token{constant} that indicates whether the parameter's value can
vary during a simulation.  A value of \val{true} indicates the
parameter's \token{value} cannot be changed by any construct
except \InitialAssignment.  Conversely, if
\token{constant}=\val{false}, other constructs in SBML, such as
rules and events, can change the \token{value} of the parameter.
More information about the effects of \token{constant} on
\token{value} is presented in Section~\ref{sec:parameter-value}.

What if a parameter has its \token{constant} attribute set to
\val{false}, but the model does not contain any rules, events or
other constructs that ever change its value over time?  Although
the model may be suspect (why is the parameter in question not
flagged as being constant?), this situation is not strictly an
error.  A value of \val{false} for \token{constant} only indicates
that a parameter \emph{can} change value, not that it \emph{must}.


\subsubsection{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}
\label{sec:parameter-sboterm}

\Parameter inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a \Parameter instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type \Parameter 
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the parameter \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the parameter in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{Example}

The following is an example of parameters defined at the \Model level:

\begin{example}
<model ...>
    ...
    <listOfParameters>
        <parameter id="tau2" value="3e-2" units="second" constant="true"/>
        <parameter id="Km1" value="10.7" units="moleperlitre" constant="true"/>
    </listOfParameters>
    ...
</model>
\end{example}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Initial assignments}
\label{sec:initialAssignment}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SBML \thisLV provides two ways of assigning initial values to
entities in a model.  The simplest and most basic is to set the
values of the appropriate attributes in the relevant
components; for example, the initial value of a model parameter
(whether it is a constant or a variable) can be assigned by
setting its \token{value} attribute directly in the model definition
(Section~\ref{sec:parameters}).  However, this approach is not
suitable when the value must be calculated, because the initial
value attributes on different components such as species,
compartments, and parameters are single values and not
mathematical expressions.  This is the reason for the introduction
of \InitialAssignment: to permit the calculation of the value of a
constant or the initial value of a variable from the values of
\emph{other} quantities in a model.  The definition of
\InitialAssignment is shown in Figure~\vref{fig:initialAssignment}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \vspace*{-1.5ex}
  \centering
  \small
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[above=0.3in] (a) {
      \emptyClassbox{\textsl{SBase}}
    };
    \node (b) {
      \begin{classbox}{\textcolor{black}{InitialAssignment}}
        symbol: SIdRef \\
      \end{classbox}
    };
    \node[right=1.3in] (c) {
      \begin{classbox}{Math}
        xmlns: string \{ "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" \} \\
        \{ \textsl{\emph{\mathml content}}. \} \\
      \end{classbox}
    };
    \draw[open triangle 60-] (a) -- (b);
    \draw[diamond-,shorten <=-4pt,shorten >=-6pt] (b) -- (c)
        node[above=6pt,left=1.75in] {\textsf{math}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \vspace*{-1.5ex}
  \caption{The definition of class \InitialAssignment.  The
    contents of the \class{Math} class can be any \mathml
    permitted in SBML; see
    Section~\protect\ref{sec:mathmlsubset}.  A
    sequence of one or more instances of \InitialAssignment
    objects can be located in an instance of
    \ListOfInitialAssignments in \Model, as shown in
    Figure~\protect\ref{fig:model}.}
  \label{fig:initialAssignment}
\end{figure}

As explained below, the provision of \InitialAssignment does not
mean that models necessarily must use this construct when defining
initial values of quantities.  If a value can be set
using the relevant attribute of a component in a model, then
that approach may be more efficient and more portable to other
software tools.  \InitialAssignment should be used when the other
mechanism is insufficient for the needs of a particular model.

Initial assignments have some similarities to assignment rules
(Section~\ref{sec:assignmentrule}).  The main differences are (a)
an \InitialAssignment can set the value of a constant whereas an
\AssignmentRule cannot, and (b) unlike \AssignmentRule, an
\InitialAssignment definition only applies up to and including the
beginning of simulation time, \ie $t \leq 0$, while an
\AssignmentRule applies at all times.


\subsubsection{The \token{symbol} attribute}

\InitialAssignment contains the mandatory attribute
\token{symbol}, of type \primtype{SIdRef}.  The value of this
attribute can be the identifier (\ie the value of the \token{id}
attribute) of a \Compartment, \Species, \SpeciesReference or
global \Parameter elsewhere in the model.  The purpose of the
\InitialAssignment is to define the initial value of the constant
or variable referred to by the \token{symbol} attribute.  (The
attribute's name is \token{symbol} rather than \token{variable}
because it may assign values to constants as well as variables in
a model; see Section~\ref{sec:initial-assignment-semantics}
below.)

An initial assignment cannot be made to reaction identifiers, that
is, the \token{symbol} attribute value of an \InitialAssignment cannot
be an identifier that is the \token{id} attribute value of a \Reaction
object in the model.  This is identical to a restriction placed on
rules (see Section~\ref{sec:ruleconstraints}).


\subsubsection{The \token{math} element}

The \token{math} element contains a MathML expression used to
calculate the value of the entity referenced by \token{symbol}.
The units of the value should match the units associated with the
identifier given in the \token{symbol} attribute.  (That is, the
units should be the units of the species, species reference,
compartment, or parameter, as appropriate for the kind of object
identified by the value of \token{symbol}.)


\subsubsection{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}
\label{sec:initialassignment-sboterm}

\InitialAssignment inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a \InitialAssignment instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type \InitialAssignment  
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the initial assignment \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the initial assignment in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{Semantics of initial assignments}
\label{sec:initial-assignment-semantics}

The value calculated by an \InitialAssignment object overrides the
value assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that
symbol.  For example, if a \Compartment's \token{size} is set in
its definition, and the model also contains an \InitialAssignment
having that compartment's \token{id} as its \token{symbol} value,
then the interpretation is that the \token{size} assigned in the
\Compartment definition should be ignored and the value assigned
based on the computation defined in the \InitialAssignment.
Initial assignments can take place for \Compartment, \Species, 
\SpeciesReference and global \Parameter objects regardless of the 
value of their \token{constant} attribute.

This does not mean that a definition of a symbol can be omitted if
there is an \InitialAssignment object for that symbol; the symbols
must always be defined even if they are assigned a value
separately.  For example, there must be a \Parameter definition
for a given parameter if there is an \InitialAssignment for that
parameter.

The actions of all \InitialAssignment objects are in general terms
the same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type
of variable being set:
\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{In the case of a species}, an \InitialAssignment sets
  the referenced species' initial quantity
  (\quantity{concentration} or \quantity{amount}) to the value
  determined by the formula in \token{math}.  (See
  Section~\ref{sec:species-units} for an explanation of how the
  units of the species' quantity are determined.)

\item \emph{In the case of a species reference}, an
  \InitialAssignment sets the initial stoichiometry of the
  referenced \SpeciesReference to the value determined by the
  formula in \token{math}.  The overall units of the formula in
  \token{math} should be \token{dimensionless}, because reactant
  and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless
  quantities.

\item \emph{In the case of a compartment}, an \InitialAssignment
  sets the referenced compartment's initial size to the size
  determined by the formula in \token{math}.  The overall units of
  the formula should be the same as the units specified for the size of the
  compartment.  (See Section~\ref{sec:compartment-units} for an
  explanation of how the units of the compartment's size are
  determined.)

\item \emph{In the case of a parameter}, an \InitialAssignment
  sets the referenced parameter's initial value to that determined
  by the formula in \token{math}.  The overall units of the
  formula should be the same as the units defined for the parameter.  (See
  Section~\ref{sec:parameter-units} for an explanation of how the
  units of the parameter are determined.)

\end{itemize}

In the context of a simulation, initial assignments establish
values that are in effect prior to and including the start of
simulation time, \ie $t \leq 0$.  Section~\ref{sec:before-t0}
provides information about the interpretation of assignments,
rules, and entity values for simulation time up to and including
the start time $t = 0$; this is important for establishing the
initial conditions of a simulation if the model involves
expressions containing the \emph{delay} \token{csymbol}
(Section~\ref{sec:csymbol-token}).

There cannot be two initial assignments for the same symbol in a
model; that is, a model must not contain two or more
\InitialAssignment objects that both have the same identifier as
their \token{symbol} attribute value.  A model must also not define
initial assignments \emph{and} assignment rules for the same
entity.  That is, there cannot be \emph{both} an
\InitialAssignment and an \AssignmentRule for the same symbol in a
model, because both kinds of constructs apply prior to and at the
start of simulated time---allowing both to exist for a given
symbol would result in indeterminism).  (See also
Section~\ref{sec:ruleconstraints}.)

The ordering of \InitialAssignment objects is not significant.
The combined set of \InitialAssignment, \AssignmentRule and
\KineticLaw objects form a set of assignment statements that must
be considered as a whole.  The combined set of assignment
statements should not contain algebraic loops: a chain of
dependency between these statements should terminate.  (More
formally, consider the directed graph of assignment statements
where nodes are a model's assignment statements and directed arcs
exist for each occurrence of a symbol in an assignment statement
\token{math} attribute.  The directed arcs in this graph start from
the statement assigning the symbol and end at the statement that
contains the symbol in their math elements.  Such a graph must be
acyclic.) Examples of valid and invalid set of assignment
statements are given in Section~\ref{sec:ruleconstraints}.

Finally, it is worth being explicit about the expected behavior in
the following situation.  Suppose (1) a given symbol has a value
$x$ assigned to it in its definition, and (2) there is an initial
assignment having the identifier as its \token{symbol} value and
reassigning the value to $y$, \emph{and} (3) the identifier is
also used in the mathematical formula of a second initial
assignment.  What value should the second initial assignment use?
It is $y$, the value assigned to the symbol by the first initial
assignment, not whatever value was given in the symbol's
definition.  This follows directly from the behavior at the
defined at the beginning of this section and in
Section~\ref{sec:before-t0}: if an \InitialAssignment object
exists for a given symbol, then the symbol's value is overridden
by that initial assignment.


\subsubsection{Example}

The following example shows how the species \val{x} can assigned
the initial value $2 \cdot y$, where \val{y} is an identifier
defined elsewhere in the model:

\begin{example}
<listOfSpecies>
    <species id="x" compartment="C" units="mole"
             hasOnlySubstanceUnits="true" boundaryCondition="false" constant="false"/>
</listOfSpecies>
...
<listOfInitialAssignments>
    <initialAssignment symbol="x">
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
              xmlns:sbml="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core">
            <apply>
                <times/> 
                <ci> y </ci> 
                <cn sbml:units="dimensionless"> 2 </cn>
            </apply>
        </math>
    </initialAssignment>
</listOfInitialAssignments>
\end{example}

The next example illustrates the more complex behavior discussed
above, when a symbol has a value assigned in its definition but
there also exists an \InitialAssignment for it \emph{and} another
\InitialAssignment uses its value in its mathematical formula.

\begin{example}
<listOfSpecies>
    <species id="x" initialAmount="50" compartment="C" units="item"
             hasOnlySubstanceUnits="true" boundaryCondition="false" constant="false"/>
</listOfSpecies>
...
<listOfInitialAssignments>
    <initialAssignment symbol="x">
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
              xmlns:sbml="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core">
            <cn sbml:units="item"> 10 </cn>
        </math>
    </initialAssignment>
    <initialAssignment symbol="othersymbol">
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
              xmlns:sbml="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core">
            <apply>
                <times/>
                <ci> x </ci>
                <cn sbml:units="dimensionless"> 2 </cn>
            </apply>
        </math>
    </initialAssignment>
</listOfInitialAssignments>
\end{example}

The value of \val{othersymbol} in the SBML excerpt above will be
\val{20}.  The case illustrates the rule of thumb that if there is
an initial assignment for a symbol, the value assigned to the
symbol in its definition (here, the value of
\token{initialAmount}) must be ignored and the value created by
the initial assignment used instead.


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Rules}
\label{sec:rules}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In SBML, \emph{Rules} provide additional ways to define the values
of variables in a model, their relationships, and the dynamical
behaviors of those variables.  \emph{Rules} enable the encoding of
relationships that cannot be expressed using reactions alone
(Section~\ref{sec:reactions}) nor by the assignment of an initial
value to a variable in a model
(Section~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}).

SBML separates rules into three subclasses for the benefit of
model analysis software.  The three subclasses are based on the
following three different possible functional forms (where $x$ is
a variable, $f$ is some arbitrary function returning a numerical
result, $\textbf{V}$ is a vector of variables that does not
include $x$, and $\textbf{W}$ is a vector of variables that may
include $x$):
\begin{center}
  \begin{edtable}{tabular}{rll}
    \emph{Algebraic}  & left-hand side is zero:             & $0 = f(\textbf{W})$\\
    \emph{Assignment} & left-hand side is a scalar:         & $x = f(\textbf{V})$\\
    \emph{Rate}       & left-hand side is a rate-of-change: & $dx/dt = f(\textbf{W})$\\
  \end{edtable}
\end{center}

In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
between \emph{assignment} and \emph{algebraic} rules.  They are
treated as separate cases for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  
\item \emph{Assignment} rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
  intermediate values for use in numerical methods;
  
\item SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for
  example the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain
  algebraic loops (discussed further in
  Section~\ref{sec:ruleconstraints});

\item Many simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of
  solving unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more
  direct forms such as assignment rules may enable those
  simulators to process models they could not process if the same
  assignments were put in the form of general algebraic equations;
  
\item Those simulators that \emph{can} solve these algebraic
  equations make a distinction between the different categories
  listed above; and
  
\item Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be
  applicable to models that do not contain \emph{algebraic} rules.

\end{itemize}

The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
abstract \Rule class containing an element,
\token{math}, to hold the right-hand side expression, then to
derive subclasses of \Rule that add attributes to
distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate rules.
Figure~\vref{fig:rules} gives the definitions of \Rule and the
subclasses derived from it.  The figure shows there are three
subclasses, \AlgebraicRule, \AssignmentRule and \RateRule derived
directly from \Rule. These correspond to the cases
\emph{Algebraic}, \emph{Assignment}, and \emph{Rate} described
above, respectively.

  \label{fig:rules}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Common attributes in \abstractclass{Rule}}
\label{sec:rule-math}\label{sec:rule-fields}\label{sec:rule-sboterm}

The classes derived from \Rule inherit \token{math} and
  the attributes and elements from \SBase, including
\token{sboTerm}.


\paragraph{The \token{math} element}

A \Rule object has a required element called \token{math},
containing a MathML expression defining the mathematical formula
of the rule.  This MathML formula must return a numerical value.
The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the
variables and other entities in an SBML model.  The interpretation
of \token{math} and the units of the formula are described in more
detail in Sections~\ref{sec:algebraicrule},
\ref{sec:assignmentrule} and~\ref{sec:raterule} below.


\paragraph{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}

\Rule inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a   \AlgebraicRule, \AssignmentRule, or
\RateRule instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type  \AlgebraicRule, \AssignmentRule, or
\RateRule indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the rule \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the rule in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{\class{AlgebraicRule}}
\label{sec:algebraicrule}

The rule type \AlgebraicRule is used to express equations that are
neither assignments of model variables nor rates of change.
\AlgebraicRule does not add any attributes to the basic \Rule; its
role is simply to distinguish this case from the other cases.  An
example of the use of \AlgebraicRule is given in
Section~\ref{sec:algeraiceg}.

In the context of a simulation, algebraic rules are in effect at
all times, $t \geq 0$.  For purposes of evaluating expressions
that involve the \emph{delay} \token{csymbol}
(Section~\ref{sec:csymbol-token}), algebraic rules are considered
to apply also at $t \leq 0$.  Section~\ref{sec:before-t0} provides
additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules,
and entity values for simulation time $t \leq 0$.

An SBML model must not be overdetermined.  The ability to define
arbitrary algebraic expressions in an SBML model introduces the
possibility that a model is mathematically overdetermined by the
overall system of equations constructed from its rules, reactions
and events.  Therefore, if an algebraic rule is introduced in a
model, for at least one of the entities referenced in the rule's
\token{math} element the value of that entity must not be
completely determined by other constructs in the model.  This
means that at least this entity must not have the attribute
\token{constant}=\val{true} and there must also not be a rate rule
or assignment rule for it.  Furthermore, if the entity is a
\Species object, its value must not be determined by reactions,
which means that it must either have the attribute
\token{boundaryCondition}=\val{true} or else not be involved in
any reaction at all.  These restricitions are explained in more
detail in Section~\ref{sec:ruleconstraints} below.


\subsubsection{\class{AssignmentRule}}
\label{sec:assignmentrule}

The rule type \AssignmentRule is used to express equations that
set the values of variables.  The left-hand side (the
\token{variable} attribute) of an assignment rule can refer to the
identifier of a \Species, \SpeciesReference, \Compartment, 
or \Parameter object in
the model (but not a reaction).  The entity identified must not
have its \token{constant} attribute set to \val{true}.  The effects of
an \AssignmentRule are in general terms the same, but differ in
the precise details depending on the type of variable being set:

\begin{itemize}
  
\item \emph{In the case of a species}, an \AssignmentRule sets the
  referenced species' quantity (\quantity{concentration} or
  \quantity{amount}) to the value determined by the formula in
  \token{math}.  The units of the formula should match the
  \emph{units of the species} (Section~\ref{sec:species-units})
  for the species identified by the \token{variable} attribute.
  
  \emph{Restrictions}: There must not be both an \AssignmentRule
  \token{variable} attribute and a \SpeciesReference \token{species}
  attribute having the same value, unless that species has its
  \token{boundaryCondition} attribute set to \val{true}.  In other
  words, an assignment rule cannot be defined for a species that
  is created or destroyed in a reaction unless that species is
  defined as a boundary condition in the model.

\item \emph{In the case of a species reference}, an
  \AssignmentRule sets the stoichiometry of the reactant or
  product referenced by the \SpeciesReference object instance to
  the value determined by the formula in \token{math}.  The
  overall units of the formula in \token{math} should be
  \token{dimensionless}, because reactant and product
  stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless quantities.

\item \emph{In the case of a compartment}, an \AssignmentRule sets
  the referenced compartment's size to the value determined by the
  formula in \token{math}.  The overall units of the formula in
  \token{math} should be the same as the units of the size of the
  compartment (Section~\ref{sec:compartment-units}).
  
\item \emph{In the case of a parameter}, an \AssignmentRule sets
  the referenced parameter's value to that determined by the
  formula in \token{math}.  The overall units of the formula in
  \token{math} should be the same as the units defined for the
  parameter (Section~\ref{sec:parameter-units}).

\end{itemize}

In the context of a simulation, assignment rules are in effect at
all times, $t \geq 0$.  For purposes of evaluating expressions
that involve the \emph{delay} \token{csymbol}
(Section~\ref{sec:csymbol-token}), assignment rules are considered
to apply also at $t \leq 0$.  Section~\ref{sec:before-t0} provides
additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules,
and entity values for simulation time $t \leq 0$.

A model must not contain more than one \AssignmentRule or
\RateRule object having the same value of \token{variable}; in
other words, in the set of all assignment rules and rate rules in
an SBML model, each variable appearing in the left-hand sides can
only appear once.  This simply follows from the fact that an
indeterminate system would result if a model contained more than
one assignment rule for the same variable or both an assignment
rule and a rate rule for the same variable.

Similarly, a model must also not contain \emph{both} an
\AssignmentRule and an \InitialAssignment for the same variable,
because both kinds of constructs apply prior to and at the start
of simulation time, \ie $t \leq 0$.  If a model contained both an
initial assignment and an assignment rule for the same variable,
an indeterminate system would result.  (See also
Section~\ref{sec:initial-assignment-semantics}.)

The value calculated by an \AssignmentRule object overrides the
value assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that
symbol.  For example, if a \Compartment's \token{size} is set in
its definition, and the model also contains an \AssignmentRule
having that compartment's \token{id} as its \token{variable}
value, then the \token{size} assigned in the \Compartment
definition is ignored and the value assigned based on the
computation defined in the \AssignmentRule.  This does \emph{not}
mean that a definition for a given symbol can be omitted if there
is an \AssignmentRule object for it.  For example, there must be a
\Parameter definition for a given parameter if there is an
\AssignmentRule for that parameter.


\subsubsection{\class{RateRule}}
\label{sec:raterule}

The rule type \RateRule is used to express equations that
determine the rates of change of variables.  The left-hand side
(the \token{variable} attribute) can refer to the identifier of a
species, species reference, compartment, or parameter (but not a 
reaction).  The
entity identified must have its \token{constant} attribute set to
\val{false}.  The effects of a \RateRule are in general terms the
same, but differ in the precise details depending on which
variable is being set:

\begin{itemize}
  
\item \emph{In the case of a species}, a \RateRule sets the rate
  of change of the species' quantity (\quantity{concentration} or
  \quantity{amount}) to the value determined by the formula in
  \token{math}.  The overall units of the formula in \token{math}
  should be \quantity{species quantity} divided by
  \quantity{time}, where the \quantity{time} units are the
  model-wide units of time described in
  Section~\ref{sec:timeunits} and the \quantity{species quantity}
  units are the \emph{units of the species} as defined in
  Section~\ref{sec:species-units}.
  
  \emph{Restrictions}: There must not be both a \RateRule
  \token{variable} attribute and a \SpeciesReference \token{species}
  attribute having the same value, unless that species has its
  \token{boundaryCondition} attribute is set to \val{true}.  This
  means a rate rule cannot be defined for a species that is
  created or destroyed in a reaction, unless that species is
  defined as a boundary condition in the model.

\item \emph{In the case of a species reference}, a \RateRule sets
  the rate of change of the stoichiometry of the reactant or
  product referenced by the \SpeciesReference object instance to
  the value determined by the formula in \token{math}.  The
  overall units of the formula in \token{math} should be
  \token{dimensionless} divided by \quantity{time} units, where
  the \quantity{time} units are the model-wide units of time
  described in Section~\ref{sec:timeunits}, because reactant and
  product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless
  quantities.
  
\item \emph{In the case of a compartment}, a \RateRule sets the
  rate of change of the compartment's size to the value determined
  by the formula in \token{math}.  The overall units of the
  formula should be \quantity{size} units divided by
  \quantity{time} units, where the \quantity{time} units are the
  model-wide units of time described in
  Section~\ref{sec:timeunits} and the \quantity{size} units are
  the units of size on the compartment
  (Section~\ref{sec:compartment-units}).

\item \emph{In the case of a parameter}, a \RateRule sets the rate
  of change of the parameter's value to that determined by the
  formula in \token{math}.  The overall units of the formula
  should be \quantity{x}/\quantity{time}, where \quantity{x} are
  the units of the parameter (Section~\ref{sec:parameter-units})
  and the \quantity{time} units are the model-wide units of time
  described in Section~\ref{sec:timeunits}.

\end{itemize}

In the context of a simulation, rate rules are in effect for
simulation time $t > 0$.  Other types of rules and initial
assignments are in effect at different times;
Section~\ref{sec:before-t0} describes these conditions.

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:assignmentrule} for
\AssignmentRule, a model must not contain more than one \RateRule
or \AssignmentRule object having the same value of
\token{variable}; in other words, in the set of all assignment
rules and rate rules in an SBML model, each variable appearing in
the left-hand sides can only appear once.  This simply follows
from the fact that an indeterminate system would result if a model
contained more than one assignment rule for the same variable or
both an assignment rule and a rate rule for the same variable.


\subsubsection{Additional restrictions on rules}
\label{sec:ruleconstraints}

An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that
a model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on
when or how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML
needs to place two additional restrictions on rule use in addition
to the conditions described above regarding the use of
\AlgebraicRule, \AssignmentRule and \RateRule.  The first concerns
algebraic loops in the system of assignments in a model, and the
second concerns overdetermined systems.


\paragraph{The model must not contain algebraic loops}

The combined set of \InitialAssignment, \AssignmentRule and
\KineticLaw objects constitute a set of assignment statements that
should be considered as a whole.  (A \KineticLaw object is counted
as an assignment because it assigns a value to the symbol
contained in the \token{id} attribute of the \Reaction object in which
it is defined.)  This combined set of assignment statements must
not contain algebraic loops---dependency chains between these
statements must terminate.  To put this more formally, consider a
directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and
directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an SBML species, species reference,
compartment or parameter symbol in an assignment statement's
\token{math} element.  Let the directed arcs point from the
statement assigning the symbol to the statements that contain the
symbol in their \token{math} element expressions.  This graph must
be acyclic.

SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can
be evaluated any number of times without the result of those
evaluations changing.  As an example, consider the following
equations:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{lll}
    x = x + 1, & y = z + 200, & z = y + 100
  \end{array}
\end{equation*}
\end{linenomath}
If this set of equations were interpreted as a set of assignment
statements, it would be invalid because the rule for $x$ refers to
$x$ (exhibiting one type of loop), and the rule for $y$ refers to
$z$ while the rule for $z$ refers back to $y$ (exhibiting another
type of loop).

Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a
valid set of assignment statements:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{lll}
    x = 10, & y = z + 200, & z = x + 100
  \end{array}
\end{equation*}
\end{linenomath}


\paragraph{The model must not be overdetermined}

An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must
not define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An
SBML model without \AlgebraicRule objects cannot be
overdetermined.

Assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic, mathematical
model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it can
be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the
model.  It should be noted that where a model contains both
reactions and events there are several sets of equations to
consider when determining whether a model is overdetermined.  The
set of equations derived from the combined set of rules and 
reactions and, for each event, the set of equations derived from
the combined set of rules and event assignments for the particular
event. 

One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which
one set of vertices represents the variables and the other the set
of vertices represents the equations.  Place edges between
vertices such that variables in the system are linked to the
equations that determine them.  A mathematical model is 
overdetermined if the maximal matchings~\citep{chartrand_1977} 
of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes representing 
equations.  (If one maximal matching has this property, then all the 
maximal matchings will have this property; \ie it is only necessary 
to find one maximal matching.)  
Appendix~\ref{apdx:assessing-overdetermined} describes
a method of applying this procedure to specific SBML data objects.
In some cases it is possible to avoid the use of an \AlgebraicRule. 
This is discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:bp:rules}.


\subsubsection{Example of rule use}
\label{sec:eg-rule-use}

This section contains an example set of rules.  Consider the
following set of equations:
\begin{linenomath}
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{lll}
      k = \dfrac{k_3}{k_2}, & s_2 = \dfrac{k \cdot x}{1 + k_2}, & A = 0.10 \cdot x
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
\end{linenomath}
This can be encoded by the following scalar rule set (where the
definitions of \texttt{x}, \texttt{s}, \texttt{k}, \texttt{k2},
\texttt{k3} and \texttt{A} are assumed to be located elsewhere in
the model and not shown in this abbreviated example):

\begin{example}
<listOfRules>
    <assignmentRule variable="k">
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <apply> <divide/> <ci> k3 </ci> <ci> k2 </ci> </apply>
        </math>
    </assignmentRule>
    <assignmentRule variable="s2">
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <apply>
                <divide/>
                    <apply> <times/> <ci> k </ci> <ci> x </ci> </apply>
                    <apply> <plus/> <cn> 1 </cn> <ci> k2 </ci> </apply>
            </apply>
        </math>
    </assignmentRule>
    <assignmentRule variable="A">
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <apply> <times/> <cn> 0.10 </cn> <ci> x </ci> </apply>
        </math>
    </assignmentRule>
</listOfRules>
\end{example}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sec:constraints}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The \Constraint object is a mechanism for stating the
assumptions under which a model is designed to operate.  The
\emph{constraints} are statements about permissible values of
different quantities in a model.  Figure~\ref{fig:constraint}
shows the definition of the \Constraint object class.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \small
  \vspace*{1ex}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/constraint-uml}
  \caption{The definition of class \Constraint.  The
      contents of the \class{Math} class can be any \mathml
      permitted in SBML, but it must return a boolean value.  As
      shown above, an instance of \Constraint can also contain
      zero or one instances of \class{Message}; this element is
      simply a wrapper (in the XML form, within \token{<message>
        \ldots{} </message>} tags) for XHTML content.  The same
      guidelines for XHTML content as explained in
      Section~\ref{sec:notes} for notes on \SBase also apply to
      the XHTML within messages in a \Constraint. A sequence of
      one or more instances of \Constraint objects can be located
      in an instance of \ListOfConstraints in \Model, as shown in
      Figure~\protect\ref{fig:model}.}
  \label{fig:constraint}
\end{figure}

The essential meaning of a constraint is this: if a dynamical
analysis of a model (such as a simulation) reaches a state in
which a constraint is no longer satisfied, the results of the
analysis are deemed invalid beginning with that point in time.
The exact behavior of a software tool, upon encountering a
constraint violation, is left up to the software; \emph{however},
a software tool must somehow indicate to the user when a model's
constraints are no longer satisfied.  (Otherwise, a user may not
realize that the analysis has reached an invalid state and is
potentially producing nonsense results.)  If a software tool does
not have support for constraints, it should indicate this to the
user when encountering a model containing constraints.


\subsubsection{The \token{math} element}

\Constraint has one required subelement, \token{math},
containing a MathML formula defining the condition of the
constraint.  This formula must return a boolean value of
\val{true} when the model is in a \emph{valid} state.  The formula
can be an arbitrary expression referencing the variables and other
entities in an SBML model.  The evaluation of \token{math} and
behavior of constraints are described in more detail in
Section~\ref{sec:constraint-semantics} below.


\subsubsection{The \token{message} element}
\label{sec:constraint-message}

A \Constraint object has an optional element called
\token{message}.  This can contain a message in XHTML format that
may be displayed to the user when the condition of the constraint
in \token{math} evaluates to a value of \val{false}.  Software
tools are not required to display the message, but it is
recommended that they do so as a matter of best practice.

The XHTML content within a \token{message} element must follow the
same restrictions as for \Notes objects
described in Section~\ref{sec:notes}.  In particular, the
\token{message} must declare the use of the XHTML XML namespace,
and must not contain an XML declaration or a DOCTYPE declaration.


\subsubsection{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}
\label{sec:constraint-sboterm}

\Constraint inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a  \Constraint instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type  \Constraint
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the constraint \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the constraint in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{Semantics of constraints}
\label{sec:constraint-semantics}

In the context of a simulation, a \Constraint has effect at all
times $t \geq 0$.  Each \Constraint's \token{math} element is first
evaluated after any \InitialAssignment definitions in a model at
$t = 0$ and can conceivably trigger at that point.  (In other
words, a simulation could fail a constraint immediately.)

\Constraint definitions \emph{cannot and should not} be used to
compute the dynamical behavior of a model as part of, for example,
simulation.  Constraints may be used as input to non-dynamical
analysis, for instance by expressing flux constraints for flux
balance analysis.

The results of a simulation of a model containing a constraint are
invalid from any simulation time at and after a point when the
function given by the \token{math} returns a value of \val{false}.
Invalid simulation results do not make a prediction of the
behavior of the biochemical reaction network represented by the
model.  The precise behavior of simulation tools is left undefined
with respect to constraints.  If invalid results are detected with
respect to a given constraint, the \token{message} element
(Section~\ref{sec:constraint-message}) may optionally be displayed
to the user.  The simulation tool may also halt the simulation or
clearly delimit in output data the simulation time point at which
the simulation results become invalid.

SBML does not impose restrictions on duplicate \Constraint
definitions or the order of evaluation of \Constraint objects in a
model.  It is possible for a model to define multiple constraints
all with the same \token{math} element.  Since the failure of any
constraint indicates that the model simulation has entered an
invalid state, a system is not required to attempt to detect
whether other constraints in the model have failed once any one
constraint has failed.


\subsubsection{Example}

As an example, the following SBML fragment demonstrates the
constraint that species \val{S1} should only have values between~1
and~100:

\begin{example}
<model ...>
    ...
    <listOfConstraints>
        <constraint>
            <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

                          <ci> S1 </ci> 
                        </apply>
                        <apply> 
                          <lt/>

                          <cn sbml:units="mole"> 100 </cn> 
                        </apply>
                </apply>
            </math>
            <message>
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> 
                  Species S1 is out of range. 
                </p>
            </message>
        </constraint>
    </listOfConstraints>
    ...
</model>
\end{example}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Reactions}
\label{sec:reactions}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A \emph{reaction} in SBML represents any kind of process that can
change the quantity of one or more species in a model.  Examples
of such processes can include transformation, transport, molecular
interactions, and more.  In SBML, the notion of a reaction is
generalized to allow entities that may not be chemical substances;
thus, a reaction in SBML does not necessarily have to be a
biochemical reaction---a biochemical reaction is just one possible
kind of process.

At minimum, to describe a reaction in SBML, it is necessary to
define its \emph{structural} properties, specifically the
participating reactants and/or products (and their corresponding
stoichiometries) and the reversibility of the process.  In
addition, an SBML reaction can also contain a \emph{quantitative}
description of the rate of the reaction; this aspect consists of a
mathematical formula expressing describing the rate at which the
reaction process takes place, together with an optional list of
modifier species and parameters influencing the reaction rate.
The various parts of a reaction are recorded in the SBML \Reaction
object class and other supporting data classes, defined in
Figure~\vref{fig:reaction}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.78]{figs/reaction-uml-v2}
  \caption{The definitions of \Reaction, \KineticLaw,
    \SpeciesReference, \ModifierSpeciesReference, \LocalParameter,
    as well as the container classes \ListOfReactants,
    \ListOfProducts, \ListOfModifiers, and \ListOfLocalParameters.
    Note that \SimpleSpeciesReference is an abstract class used
    only to provide some common attributes to its derived
    classes.}
  \label{fig:reaction}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{\class{Reaction}}
\label{sec:reaction-type}
\label{sec:listofreactants}
\label{sec:listofproducts}
\label{sec:listofmodifiers}

Each reaction in an SBML model is defined using an instance of a
\Reaction object.  As shown in Figure~\vref{fig:reaction}, it
contains several scalar attributes and several lists of other
objects.


\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}

As with most other main kinds of objects in SBML, the
\Reaction object class
includes a mandatory attribute called \token{id}, of type
\primtype{SId}, and an optional attribute \token{name}, of type
\primtype{string}.  The \token{id} attribute is used to give the
reaction a unique identifier in the model.  This identifier can be
used in mathematical formulas elsewhere in an SBML model to
represent the rate of that reaction; this usage is explained in
detail in Section~\ref{subsec:reaction-as-symbol} below.  The
\token{name} attribute can be used to give the reaction a more
free-form, descriptive name.  The \token{name} and \token{id}
attributes must be used as described in
Section~\ref{sec:idnameattribs}.


\paragraph{The lists of reactants, products and modifiers}

The species participating as reactants, products, and/or modifiers
in a reaction are declared using lists of \SpeciesReference and/or
\ModifierSpeciesReference instances stored in
\token{listOfReactants}, \token{listOfProducts} and
\token{listOfModifiers}.  \SpeciesReference and
\ModifierSpeciesReference are described in more detail in
Sections~\ref{subsec:speciesreference}
and~\ref{subsec:modifierreference} below.  Certain restrictions
are placed on the appearance of species in reaction definitions:
\begin{itemize}
  
\item The ability of a species to appear as a reactant or product
  of any reaction in a model is governed by certain combinations
  of the attributes \token{constant} and \token{boundaryCondition}
  on the \Species object instance; see
  Section~\ref{sec:species-constant} for more information.
  
\item Any species appearing in the \token{math} element of the
  \token{kineticLaw} of a \Reaction instance must be declared in
  at least one of that \Reaction's lists of reactants, products,
  and/or modifiers.  It is an error for a reaction's kinetic law
  formula to refer to species that have not been declared for that
  reaction.
  
\item A reaction definition can contain an empty list of reactants
  \emph{or} an empty list of products, but it must have at least
  one reactant or product; in other words, a reaction without any
  reactant or product species is not permitted.  (This restriction
  does not apply to modifier species, which are always optional.)

\end{itemize}


\paragraph{The \token{kineticLaw} element}

A reaction can contain up to one \KineticLaw object in the
\token{kineticLaw} element of the \Reaction.  This ``kinetic law''
defines the speed at which the process defined by the reaction
takes place.  A detailed description of \KineticLaw is left to
Section~\ref{subsec:kinetic-law} below.

The inclusion of a \KineticLaw object in an instance of a
\Reaction is optional.  For some modeling purposes, models
containing reactions without defined rates is an acceptable
alternative (and may even be the only possible option, such as
when the kinetics of the reactions are unknown).  However, missing
kinetic laws preclude the application of many model analysis
techniques, including simulation.


\paragraph{The \token{reversible} attribute}
\label{sec:reversible}

The mandatory boolean attribute \token{reversible} indicates
whether the reaction is reversible.  To say that a reaction is
\emph{reversible} is to say it can proceed in either the forward
or the reverse direction.  This information may be redundant in
cases where the reversibility of the reaction can be deduced by
inspecting the rate formula given in the kinetic law.  However, a
reaction is not required to have a kinetic law, and besides, when
a rate expression is present, it may not always be possible to
deduce the reversibility by inspecting it.  Having a separate
attribute for \token{reversible} allows certain kinds of
structural analysis, such as elementary mode analysis, even in
these cases.

Mathematically, the \token{reversible} attribute on \Reaction has
no impact on the construction of the equations for change of the
species quantities.  However, labeling a reaction as irreversible
is interpreted as an assertion that the rate expression will not
have negative values during a simulation.  Software developers may
wish to provide their software systems with a means of testing
that this condition holds.

The presence of reversibility information in two places (\ie the
rate expression in the kinetic law, and the \token{reversible}
flag) leaves open the possibility that a model could contain
contradictory information, but this would be considered to be an
error of the encoded model, rather than an invalid SBML encoding.


\paragraph{The \token{fast} attribute}
\label{sec:fast}

The boolean attribute \token{fast} is another required boolean
attribute of \Reaction.  When a model contains a value of
\val{true} for \token{fast} on any of its reactions, it indicates
that the creator of the model is distinguishing different time
scales of reactions in the system.  If a model does not
distinguish between time scales, the \token{fast} attribute should
be set to \val{false} for all reactions.

The model's reaction definitions are divided into two sets by the
values of the \token{fast} attributes.  The set of reactions
having \token{fast}=\val{true} (known as \emph{fast reactions})
should be assumed to be operating on a time scale significantly
faster than the other reactions (the \emph{slow reactions}).  Fast
reactions are considered to be instantaneous relative to the slow
reactions.  Software tools should use a pseudo steady-state
approximation for the set of fast reactions when constructing the
system of equations for the model.  More specifically, the set of
reactions that have the \token{fast} attribute set to \val{true}
forms a subsystem that should be described by a pseudo
steady-state approximation in relationship to all other reactions
in the model.  Under this description, relaxation from any initial
condition or perturbation from any intermediate state of this
subsystem would be infinitely fast.
Appendix~\ref{apdx:consequences-of-being-fast} provides a
technical explanation of an approach to solving systems with fast
reactions.

The correctness of the approximation requires a significant
separation of time scales between the fast reactions and other
processes.  It is the responsibility of the modeler or of the
software system writing the SBML model to ensure this condition is
fulfilled.

Note that the \token{fast} attribute has a significant effect on
the mathematical interpretation of a model and cannot be safely
ignored if a software tool does not implement support for the
corresponding concept.  Software systems should indicate to users
when they encounter models with reactions having
\token{fast}=\val{true} and do not have the capacity to analyze
the model using a pseudo steady-state approximation.


\paragraph{The \token{compartment} attribute on \class{Reaction}}
\label{sec:reaction-compartment}

The optional attribute \token{compartment}, of data type
\primtype{SIdRef}, can be used to indicate the compartment in
which the reaction is assumed to take place.  If the attribute is
present, its value must be the identifier of a \Compartment object
defined in the enclosing \Model object.

Similar to the \token{reversible} attribute, the value of the
\token{compartment} attribute has no direct impact on the
construction of mathematical equations for the SBML model.  When a
kinetic law is given for a reaction, the compartment location may
already be implicit in the kinetic law (although this cannot
always be guaranteed).  Nevertheless, software tools may find the
\token{compartment} attribute value useful for such purposes as
analyzing the structure of the model, guiding the modeler in
constructing correct rate formulas, and visualization purposes.


\paragraph{The \token{sboTerm} attribute on \class{Reaction}}
\label{sec:reaction-sboterm}

\Reaction inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a  \Reaction instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type  \Reaction  
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the reaction \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the reaction in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{\class{SimpleSpeciesReference}}
\label{subsec:simplespeciesreference}

As mentioned above, every species that enters into a given
reaction must appear in that reaction's lists of reactants,
products and/or modifiers.  In an SBML model, all species that may
participate in any reaction are listed in the
\token{listOfSpecies} element of the top-level \Model instance
(see Section~\ref{sec:model}).  Lists of products, reactants and
modifiers in \Reaction objects do not introduce new species,
but rather, they refer back to those listed in the model's
top-level \token{listOfSpecies}.  For reactants and products, the
connection is made using a \SpeciesReference object; for
modifiers, it is made using a \ModifierSpeciesReference 
object.  \SimpleSpeciesReference, defined in
Figure~\vref{fig:reaction}, is an abstract type that serves as the
parent class of both \SpeciesReference and
\ModifierSpeciesReference.  It is used simply to hold the attributes
and elements that are common to the latter two objects.


\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}

\SimpleSpeciesReference has optional attributes for an identifier
(\token{id}, of data type \primtype{SId}) and name (\token{name},
of data type \primtype{string}).  The \token{id} and \token{name}
attributes must be used as described in
Section~\ref{sec:idnameattribs}.

The \token{id} value (whether it is in a \SpeciesReference or
\ModifierSpeciesReference object) exists in the global namespace
of the model.  In SBML \thisLV, the only meaning defined for the
use of such identifiers concerns the \token{id} of a
\SpeciesReference object (discussed further in
Section~\ref{subsec:speciesreference}); no meaning or value is
associated with the identifiers of \ModifierSpeciesReference.
However, the identifiers are present on both object classes for
possible use by SBML Level~3 packages.


\paragraph{The \token{species} attribute}

The \SimpleSpeciesReference object class has a required attribute,
\token{species}, of data type \primtype{SIdRef}.  As with the
other attributes, it is inherited by \SpeciesReference and
\ModifierSpeciesReference.  The value of \token{species} must be
the identifier of a species defined in the enclosing \Model; the
referenced species is thereby declared as participating in the
reaction being defined.  The precise role of that species as a
reactant, product, or modifier in the reaction is determined by
the subtype of \SimpleSpeciesReference (\ie either
\SpeciesReference or \ModifierSpeciesReference) in which the
identifier appears and by the specific list of species references
in which the \SpeciesReference appears.


\paragraph{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}
\label{sec:simplespeciesreference-sboterm}

\SimpleSpeciesReference inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent class \SBase
(see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type} and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When
a value is given to this attribute in a \SimpleSpeciesReference
instance, it should be an SBO identifier belonging to the branch
for type \SimpleSpeciesReference indicated in
Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is of the
form ``the species reference \emph{is a} X'', where X is the SBO
term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow) one
that captures the role of the species reference in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{\class{SpeciesReference}}
\label{subsec:speciesreference}

\Reaction provides a way to express which species act as reactants
and which species act as products in a reaction, and to declare
their stoichiometries.  This is done using \SpeciesReference
objects.  As mentioned above in
Section~\ref{subsec:simplespeciesreference}, \SpeciesReference
inherits the mandatory attribute \token{species} and optional
attributes \token{id}, \token{name}, and \token{sboTerm} from the
parent type \SimpleSpeciesReference.  It also defines the optional
attribute \token{stoichiometry} and the mandatory attribute
\token{constant}, described below.


\paragraph{The \token{stoichiometry} attribute}

The {\em stoichiometry} of a species in a reaction describes how
much of the species changes when a reaction event takes place.  In
SBML, product and reactant stoichiometries are specified using the
optional \token{stoichiometry} on \SpeciesReference object.  The
\token{stoichiometry} attribute is of type \primtype{double} and
should contain values greater than zero (0).  A missing
\token{stoichiometry} implies that the stoichiometry is either
unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or determined
by an initial assignment (Section~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}) or
other SBML construct elsewhere in the model.

A species reference's stoichiometry is set by its
\token{stoichiometry} attribute exactly once.  If the
\SpeciesReference object's \token{constant} attribute (see below)
has the value \val{true}, then the stoichiometry is fixed and
cannot be changed except by an \InitialAssignment.  These two
methods of setting the stoichiometry (\ie using
\token{stoichiometry} directly, or using an \InitialAssignment)
differ in that the \token{stoichiometry} attribute can only be set
to a literal scalar value, whereas \InitialAssignment allows the
stoichiometry to be set using an arbitrary mathematical expression
and to values that are not expressible in the data type
\primtype{double}.  (As an example, the approach could be used to
set the stoichiometry to a rational number, something that is
occasionally useful in the context of biochemical reaction
networks.)  If the species reference's \token{constant} attribute
has the value \val{false}, the species reference's value may be
overridden by an \InitialAssignment or changed by \AssignmentRule
or \AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for simulation time $t > 0$,
it may also be changed by a \RateRule or \Event{}s.  (However,
some of these constructs are mutually exclusive; see
Sections~\ref{sec:rules} and~\ref{sec:events}.)  It is not an
error to define \token{stoichiometry} on a species reference and
also redefine the stoichiometry using an \InitialAssignment, but
the \token{stoichiometry} attribute in that case is ignored.
Section~\ref{sec:before-t0} provides additional information about
the semantics of assignments, rules and values for simulation time
$t \leq 0$.

An explanation of how exactly the stoichiometry is used in the
mathematical interpretation of the model is given in
Section~\ref{sec:about-kinetic-laws}.


\paragraph{The \token{constant} attribute}

The \SpeciesReference attribute \token{constant} is a
mandatory boolean attribute used to indicate whether the
\token{stoichiometry} value can vary during a simulation.  If
\token{constant}=\val{true}, the corresponding species'
stoichiometry in the reaction cannot be changed by other
constructs elsewhere in the model except by an \InitialAssignment.
A value of \val{false} means the stoichiometry can be changed by
other SBML constructs such as rules (see Section~\ref{sec:rules}),
as described above in the section on the \token{stoichiometry}
attribute.


\paragraph{Use of species reference identifiers in mathematical expressions}
\label{sec:reaction:speciesReferences-in-mathematical-expressions}

The value of the \token{id} attribute of a \SpeciesReference can
be used as the content of a \token{ci} element in MathML formulas
elsewhere in the model.  When the identifier appears in a \token{ci}
element, it represents the stoichiometry of the corresponding
species in the reaction where the \SpeciesReference object
instance appears.  More specifically, it represents the value of
the \token{stoichiometry} attribute on the \SpeciesReference
object.


\paragraph{The units of a {\SpeciesReference}'s stoichiometry value}

The units associated with the stoichiometry of a species reference
are always considered to be \token{dimensionless}.  This has the
following implications:
\begin{itemize}

\item When a species reference's identifier appears in
  mathematical formulas elsewhere in the model, the units
  associated the value are \token{dimensionless}.

\item The units of the \token{math} element of an \AssignmentRule,
  \InitialAssignment or \EventAssignment setting the stoichiometry
  of the species reference should be \token{dimensionless}.

\item The units of the \token{math} element of a \RateRule that
  acts on the species reference's stoichiometry should be
  identical to \token{dimensionless}/\quantity{time}, where
  \quantity{time} is the model-wide \token{time} units
  (Section~\ref{sec:timeunits}).

\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Examples}

The following is a simple example of a species reference for
species \val{X0}, with stoichiometry \val{2}, in a list of
reactants within a reaction having the identifier \val{J1}:

\begin{example}
<model ...>
    ...
    <listOfReactions>
        <reaction id="J1" reversible="false" fast="false">
            <listOfReactants>
                <speciesReference species="X0" stoichiometry="2" constant="true"/>
            </listOfReactants>
            ...
        </reaction>
        ...
    </listOfReactions>
    ...
</model>
\end{example}

The following is a more complex example of a species reference
with an id \val{sr01} and an initial assignment that assigns a
rational number to the stoichiometry:

\begin{example}
<model ...>
    ...
    <listOfInitialAssignments>
        <initialAssignment symbol="sr01">
            <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
                  xmlns:sbml="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core">
                <cn type="rational" sbml:units="dimensionless"> 3 <sep/> 2 </cn>
            </math>
        </initialAssignment>
        ...
    </listOfInitialAssignments>
	...
    <listOfReactions>
        <reaction id="J1" reversible="true" fast="false">
            <listOfReactants>
                <speciesReference id="sr01" species="X0" constant="true"/>
            </listOfReactants>
            ...
        </reaction>
        ...
    </listOfReactions>
    ...
</model>
\end{example}


A species can occur more than once in the lists of reactants and
products of a given \Reaction instance.  The effective
stoichiometry for the species is the sum of the stoichiometry
values given in the \SpeciesReference objects in the list of
products \emph{minus} the sum of stoichiometry values given in the
\SpeciesReference objects in the list of reactants.  A positive
value indicates the species is effectively a product and a
negative value indicates the species is effectively a reactant.
SBML places no restrictions on the effective stoichiometry of a
species in a reaction; for example, it can be zero.  In the
following SBML fragment, the two reactions have the same effective
stoichiometry for all their species:

\begin{example}
<reaction id="x" reversible="false" fast="false">
    <listOfReactants>
        <speciesReference species="a" stoichiometry="1" constant="true"/>
        <speciesReference species="a" stoichiometry="1" constant="true"/>
        <speciesReference species="b" stoichiometry="1" constant="true"/>
    </listOfReactants>
    <listOfProducts>
        <speciesReference species="c" stoichiometry="1" constant="true"/>
        <speciesReference species="b" stoichiometry="1" constant="true"/>
    </listProducts>
</reaction>
<reaction id="y" reversible="false" fast="false">
    <listOfReactants>
        <speciesReference species="a" stoichiometry="2" constant="true"/>
    </listOfReactants>
    <listOfProducts>
        <speciesReference species="c" stoichiometry="1" constant="true"/>
    </listProducts>
</reaction>
\end{example}



\subsubsection{\class{ModifierSpeciesReference}}
\label{subsec:modifierreference}

Sometimes a species appears in the kinetic rate formula of a
reaction but is neither created nor destroyed in that reaction
(for example, because it acts as a catalyst or inhibitor).  In
SBML, all such species are simply called \emph{modifiers} without
regard to the detailed role of those species in the model (though
a model could use SBO terms to clarify the roles; see
Section~\ref{sec:sbo}).  The \Reaction object class provides a way
to express which species act as modifiers in a given reaction.
This is the purpose of the list of modifiers available in
\Reaction.  The list contains instances of
\ModifierSpeciesReference object.

As shown in Figure~\vref{fig:reaction}, the
\ModifierSpeciesReference class inherits the mandatory attribute
\token{species} and optional attributes \token{id} and
\token{name} from the parent class \SimpleSpeciesReference; see
Section~\ref{subsec:simplespeciesreference} for their precise
definitions.  As already explained in
Section~\ref{subsec:simplespeciesreference}, no meaning is
assigned to the identifier of \ModifierSpeciesReference object
instances in SBML \thisLV, but the identifiers are available for
possible use by SBML Level~3 packages.  Note also that modifiers
in reactions also have no stoichiometries and therefore do not
possess a \token{stoichiometry} attribute.

The value of the \token{species} attribute must be the identifier of a
species defined in the enclosing \Model; this species is
designated as a modifier for the current reaction.  A reaction may
have any number of modifiers.  It is permissible for a modifier
species to appear simultaneously in the list of reactants and
products of the same reaction where it is designated as a
modifier, as well as to appear in the list of reactants, products
and modifiers of other reactions in the model.


\subsubsection{\class{LocalParameter}}
\label{subsec:localparameter}

The kinetic law of a \Reaction instance can contain a list of
local parameters that are only accessible by the kinetic law
formula of that particular reaction.  The list contains
\LocalParameter objects, each of which associates an identifier
with a value.  This identifier can then be used in the kinetic
law.  The definition of \LocalParameter is shown in
Figure~\vref{fig:reaction}.


\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}

\LocalParameter has a required attribute \token{id}, of data type
\primtype{SId}, to give the local parameter an identifier by which
the kinetic law formula can refer to it.  A local parameter can
also have an optional \token{name} attribute of type
\primtype{string}.  The identifier of a local parameter needs to
be unique only within the list of local parameters of one
reaction.  The details about the scope for identifiers are given
in Sections~\ref{sec:identifiers}
and~\ref{subsec:listoflocalparameters}, and about the use of names
in Section~\ref{sec:name}.


\paragraph{The \token{value} attribute}

The optional attribute \token{value} determines the value (of type
\primtype{double}) assigned to the identifier.  A missing
\token{value} attribute implies that the value either is unknown,
or to be obtained from an external source.  (Note that, unlike the
case with global \Parameter objects, there is no way in SBML
\thisLV for \InitialAssignment or other SBML constructs to be used
for setting the value of \LocalParameter objects, because local
parameters are local to reactions.)


\paragraph{The \token{units} attribute}

The units associated with the value of the local parameter can be
specified by the optional attribute \token{units}.  The
attribute's value must have the data type \primtype{UnitSIdRef}
(Section~\ref{sec:unitsidref}).  There are no constraints on the
units that can be assigned to a parameter; there are also no units
to inherit from the enclosing \Model object (unlike the case for,
e.g., \Species and \Compartment).

The units of the parameter are used in the following way: when a
local parameter's identifier appears in the content of the
\token{math} element of the \KineticLaw object, the units
associated with the value are those declared by the
\LocalParameter object's \token{units} attribute.


\paragraph{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}

\LocalParameter inherits an optional \token{sboTerm} attribute of
type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent class \SBase (see
Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type} and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a
value is given to this attribute in a \LocalParameter instance, it
should be an SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type
\LocalParameter indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.
The relationship is of the form ``the local parameter \emph{is a}
X'', where X is the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most
precise (narrow) one that captures the role of the local parameter
in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{\class{KineticLaw}}
\label{subsec:kinetic-law}
\label{subsec:listoflocalparameters}

The \KineticLaw object class is used to describe the rate at which
the process defined by the \Reaction takes place.  As shown in
Figure~\vref{fig:reaction}, \KineticLaw has elements called
\token{math} and \token{listOfLocalParameters}, in addition to the
attributes and elements it inherits from \SBase.


\paragraph{The \token{math} element}

As shown in Figure~\vref{fig:reaction}, \KineticLaw has an element
called \token{math} for holding a MathML formula defining the rate
of the reaction.  The expression in \token{math} may refer to
global identifiers defined in the model, or \LocalParameter object
identifiers from the \KineticLaw's list of local parameters (see
below).  However, the only \Species identifiers that can be used
in \token{math} are those declared in the lists of reactants,
products and modifiers in the \Reaction object (see
Sections~\ref{subsec:simplespeciesreference},
\ref{subsec:speciesreference} and~\ref{subsec:modifierreference}).

Section~\ref{sec:about-kinetic-laws} provides important
discussions about the meaning and interpretation of SBML ``kinetic
laws''.


\paragraph{The list of local parameters}

An instance of \KineticLaw can contain a list of one or more
\LocalParameter objects (Section~\ref{subsec:localparameter})
defining new parameters whose identifiers can be used in the
\token{math} formula.  These ``local parameters'' are optional---a
kinetic law can always refer to global \Parameter objects.  The
local parameter facility simply provides a way to add additional
parameters that may be relevant only to a specific reaction, and
that may therefore be better handled by encapsulating their
definitions within that kinetic law.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:identifiers}, reactions introduce
local namespaces for local parameter identifiers, and within a
\KineticLaw object, a local parameter whose identifier is
identical to a global identifier defined in the model takes
precedence over the value associated with the global identifier.
Note that this introduces the potential for a local parameter
definition to shadow a global identifier.  In SBML's simple symbol
system, there is no separation of symbols by class of object;
consequently, inside the kinetic law mathematical formula, the
value of a local parameter having the same identifier as a
species, compartment, parameter or other global model entity will
override the global value.  Modelers and software developers may
wish to take precautions to avoid this happening accidentally.


\paragraph{The \token{sboTerm} attribute}

\KineticLaw  inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a  \KineticLaw instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type  \KineticLaw
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the kinetic law \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the kinetic law in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\paragraph{Example}

The following is an example of a \Reaction object that defines a
reaction with identifier $J_1$, in which $X_0 \rightarrow S_1$ at
a rate given by $k \cdot [X_0] \cdot [S_2]$, where $S_2$ is a
catalyst and $k$ is a parameter, and the square brackets
symbolizes that the species quantities have units of
concentration.  The reaction is assumed to take place all in one
compartment identified as \val{c1}.  The example demonstrates the
use of species references and \KineticLaw objects.  The units
associated with the species identifiers here are
\quantity{amount}/\quantity{volume} (see
Section~\ref{sec:species}), and so the rate expression $k \cdot
[X_0] \cdot [S_2]$ needs to be multiplied by the compartment
volume (represented by its identifier, \val{c1}) to produce the
desired units of \quantity{amount}/\quantity{time} for the rate
expression.

\begin{example}
<model timeUnits="second" extentUnits="mole" substanceUnits="mole">
    <listOfUnitDefinitions>
        <unitDefinition id="per_concent_per_time">
            <listOfUnits>
                <unit kind="litre" exponent="1" scale="0" multiplier="1"/>
                <unit kind="mole"   exponent="-1" scale="0" multiplier="1"/>
                <unit kind="second" exponent="-1" scale="0" multiplier="1"/>
            </listOfUnits>
        </unitDefinition>
    </listOfUnitDefinitions>
    <listOfCompartments>
        <compartment id="c1" units="litre" size="0.001" spatialDimensions="3" constant="true"/>
    </listOfCompartments>

\subsubsection{Mathematical interpretation of SBML reactions and kinetic laws}
\label{sec:about-kinetic-laws}

In SBML, \emph{reactions} are the central mechanism for describing
processes that change the quantities of species in a model.  The
\emph{kinetic law} of an SBML reaction provides a quantitative
description of the speed with which this happens.  In this
section, we provide an interpretation of SBML kinetic laws in the
framework of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
However, the choice of ODEs as the framework is only for
exposition purposes here, in order to allow us to present a
concrete mathematical expression of the model in terms that many
readers will be familiar with; it is equally possible to translate
a model into other frameworks, and some formulations, such as
discrete stochastic systems, are indeed quite common.


\paragraph{Semantics of rate law and stoichiometry}

The \emph{stoichiometry} of a species $S$ in a reaction describes
the proportion, relative to other species participating in that
reaction, of $S$ involved in each reaction event.  For example, in
a reaction $S_1 + 2 S_2 \rightarrow S_3$, twice as many entities
of $S_2$ as entities of $S_1$ are involved each time a reaction
event is counted.  The value of the expression in the
\KineticLaw's \token{math} element describes the \emph{rate} at
which the reaction takes place.  The product of the reaction rate
(of a given reaction) and the stoichiometry (of a given species in
the reaction) describes the reaction's contribution to the rate of
change of the species's quantity in the overall system.

It is important to make clear that a ``kinetic law'' in SBML is
\emph{not} identical to a traditional rate law.  When modeling
species as continuous amounts (\eg concentrations), the rate laws
used are traditionally expressed in terms of
\quantity{concentration per time}.  Unfortunately, this approach
only works well in cases where certain assumptions hold.  Three
assumptions in particular are incompatible with generalized
multicompartmental modeling; they are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:rate-law-problems} along with the problems they
entail.

\begin{table}[tbh]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{p{2.8in}p{3.26in}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Assumption} & \textbf{Problem}\\
    \midrule
    All species that participate in a given reaction are located
    in one compartment
    &
    SBML must support reaction processes (\eg transport) that
    move species between compartments
    \\[10pt]
    Compartments are three-dimensional volume containers
    &
    SBML must support models where reactions may take place at
    interfaces (\eg 2-D membranes) between compartments, thus
    involving compartments with different dimensions
    \\[10pt]    
    Compartment volumes are constant over time
    &
    SBML must support systems with compartments that can change
    size over time \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Assumptions behind ``traditional'' rate laws, and the
    problems they imply for general multicompartmental modeling.}
  \label{tab:rate-law-problems}
\end{table}

A simple example can illustrate the problems that arise when
describing reactions between multiple volumes using
\quantity{concentration}/\quantity{time} units (which is to say,
\quantity{amount}/\quantity{volume}/\quantity{time}).  Suppose we
have two species pools $S_1$ and $S_2$, with $S_1$ located in a
compartment having volume $V_1$, and $S_2$ located in a
compartment having volume $V_2$.  Let the volume $V_2 = 3 V_1$.
Now consider a transport reaction $S_1 \rightarrow S_2$ in which
the species $S_1$ is moved from the first compartment to the
second.  Assume we only want to model the overall effect, without
getting into the molecular details (which might in reality involve
such things as pores in a membrane between the compartments).  Let
us use the simplest type of chemical kinetics, in which the rate
of the transport reaction is controlled by the activity of $S_1$
and this rate is equal to some constant $k$ times the activity of
$S_1$.  For the sake of simplicity, assume $S_1$ is in a diluted
solution and thus that the activity of $S_1$ can be taken to be
equal to its concentration $[S_1]$.  The rate expression will
therefore be $k \cdot [S_1]$, with the units of $k$ being
$1/\emph{time}$.  Then:

\begin{linenomath}
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac{d[S_2]}{dt} = -\frac{d[S_1]}{dt} = k \cdot [S_1]
  \end{equation*}
\end{linenomath}

So far, this looks normal---until we consider the number of
molecules of $S_1$ that disappear from the compartment of volume
$V_1$ and appear in the compartment of volume $V_2$.  The number
of molecules of $S_1$ (call this $n_{S_1}$) is given by $[S_1]
\cdot V_1$ and the number of molecules of $S_2$ (call this
$n_{S_2}$) is given by $[S_2] \cdot V_2$.  Since our volumes have
the relationship $V_2 / V_1 = 3$, the relationship above implies
that $n_{S_1} = k \cdot [S_1] \cdot V_1$ molecules disappear from
the first compartment per unit of time and $n_{S_2} = 3
\cdot k \cdot [S_1] \cdot V_1$ molecules appear in the second
compartment.  In other words, we have created matter out of
nothing!

The problem lies in the use of concentrations as the measure of
what is transferred by the reaction, because concentrations depend
on volumes and the scenario involves multiple unequal volumes.
The problem is not limited to using concentrations or volumes; the
same problem also exists when using density, \ie
\quantity{mass}/\quantity{volume}, as well as dependency on other
spatial distributions (\ie areas or lengths).  What must be done
instead is to consider the number of ``items'' being acted upon by
a reaction process irrespective of their distribution in space
(volume, area or length).  An ``item'' in this context may be a
molecule, particle, mass, or other ``thing'', as long as the
substance measurement is independent of the size of the space in
which the items are located and the processes take place.

In multicompartmental models, to be able to specify a rate law only
once and then use it unmodified in equations for different
species, the rate law needs to be expressed in terms of an
intensive property, that is, \quantity{species
  quantity}/\quantity{time}, rather than the extensive property
typically used, \quantity{species
  quantity}/\quantity{size}/\quantity{time}.  As a result,
modelers and software tools in general cannot insert traditional
textbook rate laws unmodified into the \token{math} element of a
\KineticLaw.  The unusual term ``kinetic law'' was chosen to alert
users to this difference.


\paragraph{Constructing rate-of-change equations for the species}
\label{sec:constructing-equations}

A consequence of approach to ``kinetic laws'' discussed in the
previous section is this: when constructing equations describing
the time-rates of change of different species defined by an SBML
model, the equations are assumed to be in terms of time-rates of
changes to \emph{amounts, not concentrations} (or more
generally \emph{densities}, \ie amount per size of compartment).
A kinetic law does \emph{not} describe how often a reaction would
take place in a compartment of unit size, but rather how often it
takes place (per time unit) given the actual size of the
compartment.  The dimension of the kinetic law is therefore
\emph{number of reaction events per time.}

When constructing a system of equations dictating the rates of
change of the different species in an SBML model, we only need to
consider those species having attribute values
\token{constant}=\val{false} and
\token{boundaryValue}=\val{false}, because as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:species-constant}, these are the only species
affected by the reactions in the model.  (Other species not
meeting these criteria may be
affected by other SBML constructs, but here, we are focusing
specifically on the implications of reactions.)

\newcommand{\si}{\ensuremath{S_i}\xspace}
\newcommand{\nsi}{\ensuremath{n_{S_i}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\rj}{\ensuremath{R_j}\xspace}
\newcommand{\rx}{\ensuremath{R_x}\xspace}
\newcommand{\vrj}{\ensuremath{v_{R_j}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\stoichij}{\ensuremath{\textrm{stoich}_{S_{i},R_{j}}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\stoichix}{\ensuremath{\textrm{stoich}_{S_{i},R_{x}}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\csi}{\ensuremath{c_{S_i}}\xspace}
\newcommand{\csg}{\ensuremath{c_{\,\textrm{model}}}\xspace}

Assume now a model in which $N$ species $S_{1}$, $S_{2}$,
\ldots{}, $S_{N}$ having attributes \token{constant}=\val{false}
and \token{boundaryValue}=\val{false} participate in $M$ reactions
$R_{1}$, $R_{2}$, \ldots{}, $R_{M}$.  Let \vrj represent the rate
or velocity of reaction \rj as given by the formula in the
\token{math} element of \KineticLaw object for \rj.  The units
associated with this rate expression are \emph{extent}/\emph{time}
units, where the extent and time units are specified by the
\token{extentUnits} and \token{timeUnits} attributes on the \Model
object, respectively.  Let \stoichij represent the effective
stoichiometry of species \si in reaction \rj.  (By ``effective
stoichiometry'', we mean the number that results from taking the
sum of the stoichiometry values of all references to \si in \rj's
\token{listOfReactants} and subtracting the sum of the
stoichiometric values of all references to \si in \rj's
\token{listOfProducts}.)  If \si is neither a reactant nor product
in some reaction \rx, then $\stoichix\!= 0$.  Finally, let \nsi
represent the amount of species \si in the model (and note that
this value is \emph{not} a concentration or density).

There are three possible cases to consider when constructing
rate-of-change equations for the species:
\begin{enumerate}

\item \emph{No conversion factors defined}.  If the \Species
  object instance for \si does not define a value for its
  \token{conversionFactor} attribute, and the \Model object also
  does define a value for its \token{conversionFactor} attribute,
  then the implication is that the units of the reaction extent
  are identical to the units of amount of species \si.  In that
  case, the formula for the rate of change of the species amount
  is as follows:
  \begin{linenomath}
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{d \nsi}{dt} = \sum_{j=1}^{M} \, \stoichij \cdot \vrj      
    \end{equation*}
  \end{linenomath}

\item \emph{Global conversion factor defined}.  If the \Model
  object instance defines a value for its \token{conversionFactor}
  attribute, \emph{and} the \Species object for \si does
  \emph{not} define a value for its \token{conversionFactor}, then
  the global conversion factor is used to convert between the
  units of reaction \emph{extent} in the model and the units of
  amount of species \si.  Let \csg represent the value of the
  parameter object identified by the \token{conversionFactor}
  attribute value on \Model (see
  Section~\ref{sec:model-conversionFactor}).  The formula for the
  rate of change of \si's amount then becomes the following:
  \begin{linenomath}
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{d \nsi}{dt} = \csg \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{M} \, \stoichij \cdot \vrj      
    \end{equation*}
  \end{linenomath}

\item \emph{Conversion factor defined for the species}.  If the
  \Species object instance for \si defines a value for its
  \token{conversionFactor} attribute, then this factor is used to
  convert between the units of reaction \emph{extent} in the model
  and the units of amount of species \si.  (The factor defined by
  the species is used regardless of whether a value also exists
  for the \Model object's \token{conversionFactor}.)  Let \csi
  represent the value of the parameter object identified by \si's
  \token{conversionFactor} attribute value (see
  Section~\ref{sec:species-conversion}).  The formula for the rate
  of change of \si's amount then becomes the following:
  \begin{linenomath}
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{d \nsi}{dt} = \csi \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{M} \, \stoichij \cdot \vrj      
    \end{equation*}
  \end{linenomath}

\end{enumerate}

In Section~\ref{sec:bp:reactions}, we present some recommendations for
how to encode rate laws and models in SBML.


\subsubsection{Use of reaction identifiers in mathematical expressions}
\label{subsec:reaction-as-symbol}

The value of the \token{id} attribute of a \Reaction can be
used as the content of a \token{ci} element in MathML formulas
elsewhere in the model. Such a \token{ci} element or symbol
represents the rate of the given reaction as given by the
reaction's \KineticLaw object. 
A \KineticLaw object in effect forms an assignment statement
assigning the evaluated value of the \token{math} element to the
symbol value contained in the \Reaction \token{id} attribute.  No
other object can assign a value to such a reaction symbol; \ie
the \token{variable} attributes of \InitialAssignment, \RateRule,
\AssignmentRule and \EventAssignment objects cannot contain the
value of a \Reaction \token{id} attribute.

The combined set of \InitialAssignment, \AssignmentRule and
\KineticLaw objects form a set of assignment statements that
should be considered as a whole.  The combined set of assignment
rules should not contain algebraic loops: a chain of dependency
between these statements should terminate.  (More formally,
consider the directed graph of assignment statements where nodes
are statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of a
symbol in a assignment statement \token{math} element. The directed
arcs start from the statement defining the symbol to the
statements that contain the symbol in their math elements. Such a
graph must be acyclic.)  Examples of valid and invalid set of
assignment statements are given in
Section~\ref{sec:ruleconstraints}.


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Events}
\label{sec:events}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\Model has an optional list of \Event objects that describe the
time and form of explicit instantaneous discontinuous state
changes in the model.  For example, an event may describe that one
species quantity is halved when another species' quantity exceeds a
given threshold value.

An \Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables
that are affected by the event, and how the variables are
affected.  The effect of the event can optionally be delayed after
the occurrence of the condition which invokes it.  Conceptually,
the operation of an event is divided into two phases (even when
the event is not delayed): one when the event is \emph{fired} and
the other when the event is \emph{executed}. The \Event type is
defined in Figure~\vref{fig:event}.  The object classes \Event,
\Trigger, \Delay and \EventAssignment are derived from \SBase{}
(see Section~\ref{sec:sbase}).  An example of a model which uses
events is given below.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \vspace*{3ex}
  \centering
  \small
  \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/event-uml}
  \caption{The definitions of \Event, \Trigger, \Delay,
    \EventAssignment, and \ListOfEventAssignments.}
  \label{fig:event}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{\class{Event}}

An \Event definition has two required parts: a trigger condition
and at least one \EventAssignment.  In addition, an event can
include an optional delay.  These features of \Event are described
below.


\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}
\label{sec:event-id-name}

As with most components in SBML, an \Event has \token{id} and
\token{name} attributes, but in the case of \Event, both are optional.
These attributes operate in the manner described in
Section~\ref{sec:idnameattribs}.


\paragraph{The optional \token{sboTerm} attribute on \class{Event}}
\label{sec:event-sboterm}

\Event inherits an optional \token{sboTerm} attribute of type
\primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent class \SBase (see
Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type} and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a
value is given to this attribute in a \Event instance, it should
be an SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type \Event
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The
relationship is of the form ``the event \emph{is a} X'', where X
is the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise
(narrow) one that captures the role of the event in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\paragraph{The \token{useValuesFromTriggerTime} attribute}
\label{sec:event-usevaluesfromtriggertime}

The optional \Delay on \Event means there are two times to
consider when computing the results of an event: the time at which
the event \emph{fires}, and the time at which assignments are
\emph{executed}.  It is also possible to distinguish between the
time at which the \EventAssignment's expression is calculated, and
the time at which the assignment is made: the expression could be
evaluated at the same time the assignments are performed, i.e.,
when the event is \emph{executed}, but it could also be defined to
be evaluated at the time the event \emph{fired}.

The mandatory attribute \token{useValuesFromTriggerTime} on \Event
allows a model to indicate the time at which the event's
assignments are intended to be evaluated.  A value of \val{true}
indicates that values of the assignment formulas are to be
computed at the moment the event fired, not after the delay.  If
\token{useValuesFromTriggerTime}=\val{false}, it means that the
formulas in the event's assignments are to be computed after the
delay, at the time the event is executed.


\subsubsection{\class{Trigger}}
\label{sec:trigger}
\label{sec:event-trigger}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:event}, the \token{trigger} element of
an \Event must contain exactly one object of class \Trigger.  This
object contains one \token{math} element containing a MathML
expression.  The expression must evaluate to a value of type
\primtype{boolean}.  The exact moment at which the expression
evaluates to \val{true} is the time point when the \Event is
\emph{fired}.

An event only fires when its \Trigger expression makes the
transition in value from \val{false} to \val{true}.  The event
will also fire at any future time points when the \token{trigger}
make this transition; in other words, an event can fire multiple
times during a simulation if its trigger condition makes the
transition from \val{false} to \val{true} more than once.

An important question is whether an event can fire prior to, or
at, initial simulation time, \ie $t \leq 0$.  The answer is no: an
event can only be triggered immediately after initial simulation
time \ie $t > 0$.


\paragraph{The optional \token{sboTerm} attribute on \class{Trigger}}
\label{sec:trigger-sboterm}

\Trigger inherits an optional \token{sboTerm} attribute of type
\primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent class \SBase (see
Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type} and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a
value is given to this attribute in a \Trigger instance, it should
be an SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type \Trigger
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The
relationship is of the form ``the trigger \emph{is a} X'', where X
is the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise
(narrow) one that captures the role of the trigger in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\subsubsection{\class{Delay}}
\label{sec:event-delay}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:event}, an \Event object can contain
an optional \token{delay} element of class \Delay.  The \Delay is
derived from \SBase and contains a mathematical formula stored in
\token{math}.  The formula is used to compute the length of time
between when the event has \emph{fired} and when the event's
assignments (see below) are actually \emph{executed}.  If no delay
is present on a given \Event, no delay is defined for that event.

The expression in the \Delay object's \token{math} element must be
evaluated at the time the event is \emph{fired}.  The expression
must always evaluate to a nonnegative number (otherwise, a
nonsensical situation could arise where an event is defined to
fire before it is triggered!).


\paragraph{Units of delay expressions}

The units of the numerical value computed by a \Delay instance's
\token{math} expression should match the model's units of
\quantity{time} (meaning the definition of the \val{timeUnits} in
the model; see Section~\ref{sec:model-timeUnits}).  Note that, as
in other cases of MathML expressions in SBML, units are \emph{not}
automatically predefined or assumed.  As discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:operator-arg-types}, expressions containing only
literal numbers and/or \Parameter objects without declared units
are considered to have unspecified units.  In such cases, the
correspondence between the needed units and the (unknown) units of
the \Delay \token{math} expression cannot be proven, and while
such expressions are not considered inconsistent, all that can be
assumed by model interpreters (whether software or human) is that
the units \emph{may} be consistent.

The following \Event example fragment helps illustrate this:
\label{sec:event:delay:example}

\begin{example}
<model timeUnits="second" ...>
    ...
    <listOfEvents>
        <event useValuesFromTriggerTime="true">
            ...
            <delay>
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                    <cn> 10 </cn>
                </math>
            </delay>
            ...
        </event>
    </listOfEvents>
    ...
</model>
\end{example}

Note that the \val{<cn> 10 </cn>} within the mathematical formula
has no specified units attached to it.  The model is not invalid
because of this, but a recipient of the model may justifiably be
concerned about what \val{10} really means.  (Ten seconds?  What
if the global units of time on the model were changed from seconds
to milliseconds?  Would the modeler remember to change \val{10} to
\val{10~000}?)  A better approach would be to declare the units
explicitly, as in the following example:

\begin{example}
<model timeUnits="second" ...>
    ...
    <listOfEvents>
        <event useValuesFromTriggerTime="true">
            ...
            <delay>
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
                      xmlns:sbml="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core">
                    <cn sbml:units="second"> 10 </cn>
                </math>
            </delay>
            ...
        </event>
    </listOfEvents>
    ...
</model>
\end{example}

Another approach would be to define a global \Parameter object for
the desired time delay, assign units to that parameter, and
replace the \token{cn} element in the example above with a
\token{ci} element referencing the parameter's identifier.


\paragraph{The optional \token{sboTerm} attribute on \class{Delay}}
\label{sec:delay-sboterm}

\Delay  inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a  \Delay instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type  \Delay
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the delay \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the delay  in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.



\subsubsection{\class{EventAssignment}}
\label{sec:eventassignment}
\label{sec:listofeventassignments}

\Event contains an optional element called
\token{listOfEventAssignments}, of class \ListOfEventAssignments.
In every instance of an event definition in a model, the object's
\token{listOfEventAssignments} element must have a non-empty list
of one or more \token{eventAssignment} elements of class
\EventAssignment.  The object class \EventAssignment has one
required attribute, \token{variable}, and a required element,
\token{math}.  Being derived from \SBase, it also has all the
usual attributes and elements of its parent class.

An ``event assignment'' has effect when the event is
\emph{executed}; that is, at the end of any given delay period (if
given) following the moment that the \Event is triggered.  See
Section~\ref{sec:events-semantics} below for more information
about events and event assignments in SBML.


\paragraph{The \token{variable} attribute}

The \token{variable} attribute is of type \primtype{SIdRef} and can
contain the identifier of a \Compartment, \Species, \SpeciesReference,
or \Parameter instance defined in the model.  
When the event is executed, the value of
the model component identified by \token{variable} is changed by
the \EventAssignment to the value computed by the \token{math}
element; that is, a species' quantity, species reference's stoichiometry, 
compartment's size or parameter's value are reset to the value 
computed by \token{math}.

Certain restrictions are placed on what can appear in
\token{variable}:
\begin{itemize}
  
\item The object identified by the value of the \token{variable}
  attribute must not have its \token{constant} attribute set 
  to \val{true}.  (Constants cannot be affected by events.)
  
\item The \token{variable} attribute must not contain the
  identifier of a reaction; only species, species references,
  compartment and parameter values may be set by an \Event.
  
\item The value of every \token{variable} attribute must be unique
  among the set of \EventAssignment objects within a given
  \Event instance.  In other words, a single event cannot have
  multiple \EventAssignment{}s assigning the same variable.  (All
  of them would be performed at the same time, when that
  particular \Event triggers, resulting in indeterminacy.)
  Separate \Event instances can refer to the same variable.
  
\item A variable cannot be assigned a value in an \EventAssignment
  object instance and also be assigned a value by an
  \AssignmentRule, \ie the value of the \token{variable} attribute
  in an \EventAssignment instance cannot be the same as the value
  of a \token{variable} attribute in an \AssignmentRule instance.
  (Assignment rules hold at all times, therefore it would be
  inconsistent to also define an event that reassigns the value of
  the same variable.)

\end{itemize}



Note that the time of assignment of the object identified by the
value of \token{variable} is always the time at which the \Event
is \emph{executed}, not when it is \emph{fired}.  The timing is
controlled by the optional \Delay in an \Event.  The time of
assignment is not affected by the \token{useValuesFromTriggerTime}
attribute on \Event---that attribute affects the time at which the
\EventAssignment's \token{math} expression is evaluated.  In other
words, SBML allows decoupling the time at which the
\token{variable} is assigned from the time at which its value
expression is calculated.




\paragraph{The optional \token{sboTerm} attribute on \class{EventAssignment}}
\label{sec:eventassignment-sboterm}

\EventAssignment   inherits an optional \token{sboTerm}
attribute of type \primtype{SBOTerm} from its parent
class \SBase (see Sections~\ref{sec:sboterm-type}
and~\ref{sec:sboTerm}).  When a value is given to this
attribute in a  \EventAssignment  instance, it should be an
SBO identifier belonging to the branch for type  \EventAssignment 
indicated in Table~\ref{tab:sboterm-availability}.  The relationship is
of the form ``the event assignment \emph{is a} X'', where X is
the SBO term.  The term chosen should be the most precise (narrow)
one that captures the role of the event assignment  in the model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sboTerm}, SBO labels are optional
information on a model.  Applications are free to ignore
\token{sboTerm} values.  A model must be interpretable without the
benefit of SBO labels.


\paragraph{\class{EventAssignment}'s \token{math}}

The \token{math} element contains a MathML expression that defines
the new value of the object identified by the \token{variable}.

The time at which this expression is evaluated is determined by
\Event's \token{useValuesFromTriggerTime} attribute.  If the
attribute value is \val{true}, the expression must
be evaluated when the event is \emph{fired}; more precisely, the
values of identifiers occurring in MathML \token{ci} attributes in
the \EventAssignment's \token{math} expression are the values they
have at the point when the event \emph{fired}.  If, instead,
\token{useValuesFromTriggerTime}'s value is \val{false}, it means
the values at \emph{execution} time should be used; that is, the
values of identifiers occurring in MathML \token{ci} attributes in
the \EventAssignment's \token{math} expression are the values they
have at the point when the event \emph{executed}.


\paragraph{Units of the \token{math} formula in \class{EventAssignment}}

In all cases, as would be expected, the units of the formula
contained in the \token{math} element of
\EventAssignment should be consistent with the units of the object
identified by the \token{variable} attribute.  More
precisely:
\begin{itemize}
  
\item \emph{In the case of a species}, an \EventAssignment sets
  the referenced species' quantity (\quantity{concentration} or
  \quantity{amount}) to the value determined by the formula in
  \token{math}.  The overall units of the \token{math} formula
  should be identical to the \emph{units of the species} as
  defined in Section~\ref{sec:species-units}.
  
\item \emph{In the case of a species reference}, an
  \EventAssignment sets the value of the \token{stoichiometry}
  attribute of the referenced \SpeciesReference object to the
  value determined by the formula in \token{math}.  The overall
  units of the formula in \token{math} should be
  \token{dimensionless}, because reactant and product
  stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless quantities.

\item \emph{In the case of a compartment}, an \EventAssignment
  sets the referenced compartment's size to the size determined by
  the formula in \token{math}.  The overall units of the formula
  should be identical to the units specified for the size of the
  compartment identified by the value of the \EventAssignment's
  \token{variable} attribute.  (See
  Section~\ref{sec:compartment-units} for an explanation of how
  the units of the compartment's size are determined.)
  
\item \emph{In the case of a parameter}, an \EventAssignment sets
  the referenced parameter's value to that determined by the
  formula in \token{math}.  The overall units of the formula should
  be identical to the units defined for the parameter identified
  by the value of the \EventAssignment's \token{variable}
  attribute.  (See Section~\ref{sec:parameter-units} for
  an explanation of how the units of the parameter are
  determined.)

\end{itemize}

Note that the formula placed in the \token{math} element has no
assumed units.  The consistency of the units of the formula, and
the units of the entity which the assignment affects, should be
explicitly established just as in the case of the value of
\token{delay}.

\subsubsection{Example \class{Event} definitions}

A example of an \Event object follows.  This structure makes the
assignment $k_2 = 0$ at the point when $P_1 \leq P_2$:

\begin{example}

<event>
    ...
    <listOfUnitDefinitions>
        <unitDefinition id="per_second">
            <listOfUnits>
                <unit kind="second" exponent="-1" multiplier="1" scale="0"/>
            </listOfUnits>
        </unitDefinition>
    </listOfUnitDefinitions>
    ...
    <listOfParameters>
        ...
        <parameter id="k2" value="0.05" units="per_second" constant="false"/>
        <parameter id="k2reset" value="0.0" units="per_second" constant="true"/>
        ...
    </listOfParameters>
    ...
    <listOfEvents>
        <event useValuesfromTriggerTime="true">
            <trigger>
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                    <apply>
                        <leq/>
                        <ci> P_1 </ci>
                        <ci> P_2 </ci>
                    </apply>
                </math>
            </trigger>
            <listOfEventAssignments>
                <eventAssignment variable="k2">
                    <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                        <ci> k2reset </ci>
                    </math>
                </eventAssignment>
            <listOfEventAssignments>
        </event>
    </listOfEvents>
    ...
</model>

\end{example}

A complete example of a model using events is given in
Section~\ref{sec:eventeg}.


\subsubsection{Detailed semantics of events}
\label{sec:events-semantics}

The description of events above describes the action of events in
isolation from each other.  This section describes how events
interact.

Events whose \token{trigger} expression is true at the start of a
simulation do not \emph{fire} at the start of the simulation ($t =
0$).  Events \emph{fire} only when the trigger \emph{becomes}
true, \ie the trigger expression transitions from \val{false} to
\val{true}, which cannot happen at $t = 0$ but can happen at $t >
0$.

Any transition of a \token{trigger} expression from \val{false} to
\val{true} will cause an event to \emph{fire}.  Consider an \Event
object definition $E$ with delay $d$ where the \token{trigger}
expression makes a transition from \val{false} to \val{true} at
times $t_1$ and $t_2$.  The \EventAssignment within the \Event
object will have effect at $t_1+d$ and $t_2+d$ irrespective of the
relative times of $t_1$ and $t_2$. For example events can
``overlap'' so that $t_1 < t_2 < t_1+d$ still causes an event
assignments to occur at $t_1+d$ and $t_2+d$.

It is entirely possible for two events to be \emph{executed}
simultaneously in simulated time, and it is possible for events to
\emph{fire} other events (\ie an event assignment can cause an
event to \emph{fire}).  This leads to several points:
\begin{itemize}

\item A software package should retest all event triggers after
  executing an event assignment in order to account for the
  possibility that the assignment causes another event trigger to
  transition from \val{false} to \val{true}.

\item It is assumed that, although the precise time at which these
  events are executed is not resolved beyond the given point in
  simulated time, the order in which the events occur \emph{is}
  resolved.  This order can be significant in determining the
  overall outcome of a given simulation.  When an event $X$
  \emph{fires} another event $Y$ and event $Y$ has zero delay,
  then event $Y$ is added to the existing set of simultaneous
  events that are pending \emph{execution}.  Events such as $Y$ do
  not have a special priority or ordering.  Events $X$ and $Y$
  form a cascade of events at the same point in simulation time.

\item All events in a model are open to being in a cascade.  The
  position of an event in the event list does not affect whether
  it can be in the cascade: $Y$ can be triggered whether it is
  before or after $X$ in the list of events.  A cascade of events
  can be potentially infinite (never terminate); when this occurs
  a simulator should indicate this has occurred---it is incorrect
  for a simulator to break a cascade arbitrarily and continue the
  simulation without at least indicating the infinite cascade
  occurred.

\item A variable can change more than once when processing
  simultaneous events at simulation time $t$.  The model behavior
  (output) for such a variable is the value of the variable at the
  end of processing all the simultaneous events at time $t$.

\end{itemize}

% Here it pays to reflect more carefully about what a reaction is.
% A reaction represents a process occuring over time.  the process
% acts on the reactants, transforming them in some way into the
% products.  the transformation may be anything from a change in
% the nature of the reactants to a simple relocation without any
% change to the nature of the reactants; for the purpose of talking
% about the speed of the reaction it does not matter.

% The ``kinetic law'' is a statement about the speed at which the
% process takes place, or more precisely, the frequency of the
% events occuring in this process.  It is by default in terms of
% moles per second, which has some intuitive appeal when dealing
% with chemical substances.  But notice that a ``mole'' is actually
% a statement about numbers of ``things'': it is 6.02e23 of whatever
% is involved.  In the case of chemical species, it is molecules of
% the substance.  To say ``one mole of'' is a shorthand way of
% saying ``6.02e23 molecules of''.  Thus, a reaction expressed as
% ``X moles per second'' is a statement that the process involves
% ``(X times 6.02e23) items per second''.

% 1 kg/sec is 1 kg/sec

% If in a reaction, the units of the species are the same as the
% reaction's substance units (default mole, redefinable by
% redefining ``substance''; sec section x), then the stoichiometries
% represent simply the ratios of the participating species: 1 mole
% of this to 2 moles of that, and so on.  If instead the species are
% given in different units, then the species quantities must be
% converted to be consistent with the units of the reaction.  Thus,
% the SBML stoichiometry may then have to incorporate a conversion:
% the stoichiometry will represent the product of the biochemical
% reaction stoichiometry and a ratio between the species substance
% and the reaction substance.

% don't forget units of reaction id
