When the value of the attribute \token{variable} of an \EventAssignment
object is the identifier of a \SpeciesReference object in the model, the
units of the mathematical expression in the \EventAssignment's \token{math}
expression should be consistent with the units of stoichiometry, that is,
\token{dimensionless}.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:eventassignment}.)
