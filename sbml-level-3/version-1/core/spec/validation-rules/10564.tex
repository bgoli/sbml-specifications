When the value of the attribute \token{variable} of an \EventAssignment
object is the identifier of a \SpeciesReference object, the units of the
mathematical expression in the \EventAssignment's MathML \token{math}
expression should be consistent with the units of stoichiometry, i.e.,
\token{dimensionless}.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:eventassignment}.)
