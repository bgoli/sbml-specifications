When the value of the \token{variable} attribute of an \EventAssignment
object definition is the identifier of a \SpeciesReference object in the
model, the units of the mathematical expression in the \EventAssignment's
\token{math} expression should be consistent with the units of
stoichiometry, that is, \token{dimensionless}.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:eventassignment}.)
