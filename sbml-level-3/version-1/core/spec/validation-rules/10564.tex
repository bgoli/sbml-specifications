When the \token{variable} attribute of an \EventAssignment
contains the identifier of a \SpeciesReference in the model, the
units of the mathematical expression in the
\EventAssignment's \token{math} expression should be
consistent with the units of stoichiometry,
that is, \token{dimensionless}.
(References: L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:eventassignment}.)
