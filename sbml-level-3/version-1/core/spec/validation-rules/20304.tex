Inside the \token{lambda} element of a \FunctionDefinition object
definition, if a \token{ci} element is not the first element within a
MathML \token{apply}, then the \token{ci}'s value can only be an identifier
provided as the value of a \token{bvar} element declared in that
\token{lambda}.  This restriction also applies to the \token{csymbol} for
time.  In other words, all model quantities and variables referenced inside
a function definition must be passed as arguments to that function.
