When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in a \RateRule object
refers to a \Species object, the units of the rule's right-hand side should
be of the form \emph{x per time}, where \emph{x} is the units of that
species' quantity and \emph{time} refers to the units of time for the
model.  (References: SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
