The units of the \token{math} formula in a \KineticLaw object definition
should be equivalent to the units of \quantity{extent per time}, where
\quantity{extent} refers to the units of extent in the model and
\quantity{time} refers to the units of time for the model.  (References:
SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{subsec:kinetic-law}.)
