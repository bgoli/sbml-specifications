The units of the formula in a \token{math} element within a \KineticLaw
object should be equivalent to the units of \quantity{extent per time},
where \quantity{extent} refers to the units of extent in the model and
\quantity{time} refers to the units of time for the model.  (References:
SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{subsec:kinetic-law}.)
