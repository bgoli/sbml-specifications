When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in a \RateRule object
refers to a \Parameter object, the units of the rule's right-hand side
should be of the form \emph{x per time}, where \emph{x} is the value of the
\token{units} attribute in that \Parameter object and \emph{time} refers to
the units of time for the model.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
