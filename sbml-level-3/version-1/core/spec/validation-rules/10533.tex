When the \token{variable} in a \RateRule object definition refers to a
\Parameter object, the units of the rule's right-hand side should be of the form
\emph{x per time}, where \emph{x} is the value of the \token{units}
attribute in the \Parameter object and \emph{time} refers to the units of
time for the model.  (References: SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
