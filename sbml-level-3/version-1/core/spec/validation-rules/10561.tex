When the \token{variable} attribute of an \EventAssignment object
definition contains the identifier of a \Compartment object in the model,
the units of the mathematical expression in the \EventAssignment's
\token{math} expression should be consistent with the units of the
compartment's size.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:eventassignment}.)
