When the \token{variable} in an \InitialAssignment object definition refers
to a \SpeciesReference object, the units of the \InitialAssignment's
\token{math} expression should be consistent with the units of
stoichiometry, that is, \token{dimensionless}.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}.)
