When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in an \InitialAssignment
object refers to a \SpeciesReference object, the units of the
\InitialAssignment's MathML \token{math} expression should be consistent
with the units of stoichiometry, that is, \token{dimensionless}.
(References: SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}.)
