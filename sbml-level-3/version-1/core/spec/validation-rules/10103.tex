An SBML XML document must conform to the schema(s) for the corresponding
SBML Level, Version and Release.  The schema(s) for SBML defines the basic
SBML object structure, the data types used by those objects, and the order
in which the objects may appear in an SBML document.  (References: SBML
L2V2 Section~4.1; L2V3 Section~4.1; L2V4 Section~4.1; L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:sbml}.)
