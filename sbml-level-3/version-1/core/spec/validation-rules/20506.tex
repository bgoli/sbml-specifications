(Rule does not apply in SBML \thisLV.)


%The \token{outside} attribute value of a given \Compartment
%instance cannot be a compartment having a \token{spatialDimensions} value of
%\val{0}, unless both compartments have \token{spatialDimensions}=\val{0}.
%Simply put, a zero-dimensional compartment cannot enclose compartments that
%have anything other than zero dimensions themselves.  (References: L2V2
