When the \token{variable} in a \RateRule definition refers to a
\SpeciesReference, the units of the rule's right-hand side should be of the
form \quantity{x per time}, where \quantity{x} is the units of
stoichiometry, that is, \token{dimensionless}, and \quantity{time} refers
to the units of time for the model.  (References: L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
