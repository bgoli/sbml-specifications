When the \token{variable} in a \RateRule definition refers to a \SpeciesReference,
the units of the rule's right-hand side should be of the form \emph{x per
time}, where \emph{x} is the units of stoichiometry,
that is, \emph{dimensionless},
and \emph{time} refers to the units of time for the model.  (References:
L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
