When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in a \RateRule object
refers to a \SpeciesReference object, the units of the rule's right-hand
side should be of the form \quantity{x per time}, where \quantity{x} are
the units of stoichiometry, that is, \token{dimensionless}, and
\quantity{time} refers to the units of time for the model.  (References:
SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
