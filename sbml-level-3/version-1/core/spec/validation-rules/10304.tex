The value of the attribute \token{variable} of every \AssignmentRule and
\RateRule objects must be unique across the set of all \AssignmentRule and
\RateRule objects in a model.  In other words, a given model component
cannot be the subject of both an assignment rule and a rate rule
simultaneously.  (References: SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:assignmentrule}.)
