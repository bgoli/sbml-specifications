If the \token{units} attribute on a \Compartment object having
\token{spatialDimensions} of \val{2} has not been set, then the units of
the compartment's size are determined by the value of the enclosing \Model
object's \token{areaUnits} attribute.  If neither the \Compartment object's
\token{units} nor the enclosing \Model object's \token{areaUnits}
attributes are set, the units of compartment size are undefined.
