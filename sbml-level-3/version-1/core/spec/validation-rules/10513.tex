When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in an \AssignmentRule
object refers to a \Parameter object, the units of the mathematical
expression in the rule's \token{math} element should be consistent with the
units declared for that parameter.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:assignmentrule}.)
