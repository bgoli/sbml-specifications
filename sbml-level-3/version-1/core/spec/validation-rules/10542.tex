For every \Species object participating in a reaction (that is, referenced
by a \SpeciesReference or \ModifierSpeciesReference object), the unit of
measurement of the species' substance times the unit of the conversion
factor for that species should be consistent with the unit of \emph{extent}
for the model.  More precisely, the product of the units indicated by the
\token{substanceUnits} and \token{conversionFactor} attributes (whether
those attributes are set directly on the \Species object or inherited from
the enclosing \Model object) should be consistent with the unit specified
by the \Model object's \token{extentUnits} attribute value.  (References:
SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:model-extentUnits}.)
