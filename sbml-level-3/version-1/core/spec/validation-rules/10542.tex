For every \Species object participating in a reaction (that is, referenced
by a \SpeciesReference or \ModifierSpeciesReference), the units of
substance times the units of the conversion factor for that species should
be equivalent to the units of \emph{extent} for the model.  More precisely,
the product of \token{substanceUnits} and \token{conversionFactor} (whether
those attribute values are set directly on the \Species object or inherited
from the \Model) should be equal to the units specified by the \Model's
\token{extentUnits} attribute value.  (References: L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:model-extentUnits}.)
