All species referenced in the \KineticLaw formula of a given reaction must
first be declared using \SpeciesReference or \ModifierSpeciesReference.
More formally, if a \Species identifier appears in a \token{ci} element of
a \Reaction's \KineticLaw formula, that same identifier must also appear in
at least one \SpeciesReference or \ModifierSpeciesReference in the
\Reaction object definition.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{subsec:kinetic-law}.)
