Inside the \token{lambda} MathML element within a \FunctionDefinition
object, the identifier of that object (i.e., value of the
\FunctionDefinition's \token{id} attribute) cannot appear as the value of a
\token{ci} element.  Such usage would entail a recursive function call, but
SBML functions are not permitted to be recursive.  (References: SBML L3V1
Sections~\ref{sec:ci-token} and~\ref{sec:function-definition-math}.)
