When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in an \InitialAssignment
object refers to a \Compartment object, the units of the
\InitialAssignment's \token{math} expression should be consistent with the
units of that compartment's size.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}.)
