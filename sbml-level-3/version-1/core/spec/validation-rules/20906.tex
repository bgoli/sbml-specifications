There must not be circular dependencies in the combined set of
\InitialAssignment, \AssignmentRule and \KineticLaw definitions in a model.
Each of these constructs has the effect of assigning a value to an
identifier (\ie the identifier given in the attribute \token{symbol} in
\InitialAssignment, the attribute \token{variable} in \AssignmentRule, and the
attribute \token{id} on the \KineticLaw's enclosing \Reaction).  Each of these
constructs computes the value using a mathematical formula.  The formula
for a given identifier cannot make reference to a second identifier whose
own definition depends directly or indirectly on the first identifier.
