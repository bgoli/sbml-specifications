If the attribute \token{units} on a \Compartment object having a
\token{spatialDimensions} attribute value of \val{3} has not been set, then
the units of the compartment's size are determined by the value of the
enclosing \Model object's \token{volumeUnits} attribute.  If neither the
\Compartment object's \token{units} nor the enclosing \Model object's
\token{volumeUnits} attributes are set, the units of compartment size are
undefined.  (References: SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:compartment-units}.)
