If the \token{units} attribute on a \Compartment object having
\token{spatialDimensions} of \val{3} has not been set, then the units of
the compartment's size are determined by the value of the enclosing \Model
object's \token{volumeUnits} attribute.  If neither the \Compartment
object's \token{units} nor the enclosing \Model object's
\token{volumeUnits} attributes are set, the units of compartment size are
undefined.  (References: SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:compartment-units}.)
