If the \token{units} attribute on a \Compartment having
\token{spatialDimensions} of \val{3} has not been set, then the units of
the compartment's size are determined by the value of the \Model's
\token{volumeUnits} attribute.  If neither the \Compartment's \token{units}
nor the \Model's \token{volumeUnits} attributes are set, the units of
compartment size are undefined.  (References: L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:compartment-units}.)
