A \Reaction object definition must contain at least one \SpeciesReference
object, either in its \ListOfReactants or its \ListOfProducts.  A reaction
without any reactant or product species is not permitted, regardless of
whether the reaction has any modifier species.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{subsec:speciesreference}.)
