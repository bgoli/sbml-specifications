When the value of the attribute \token{variable} in an \AssignmentRule
object refers to a \Compartment object, the units of the mathematical
expression in the rule's MathML \token{math} element should be consistent
with the units of that compartment's size.  (References: SBML L3V1
Section~\ref{sec:assignmentrule}.)
