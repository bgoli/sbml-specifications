If an \Event's \token{useValuesFromTriggerTime} attribute has the value
\val{false}, then the \Event must contain a \Delay element.  The
implication of \token{useValuesFromTriggerTime}=\val{false} is that there
is a delay between the time of trigger and the time of value assignments
performed by the \Event.  (References: SBML L3V1 Section~\ref{sec:events}.)
