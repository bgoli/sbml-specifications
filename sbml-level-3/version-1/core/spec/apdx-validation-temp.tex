\section{Validation and Consistency checks for SBML}
\label{apdx:validation-rules}

The SBML specification is designed to allow modelers a high degree
of flexibility.  An SBML document that adheres to the specification 
will be considered valid, but if the modeler has chosen to only
partially declare optional attributes there may be inconsistencies
within the model, for example with units.  This section outlines a 
set of validation rules that must be followed to produce valid SBML 
and sets of consistency checks that can be applied to eliminate  
inconsistencies where this is desireable.

Note that since validation rule numbers remain unique, missing numbers
here merely indicate rules that applied in previous levels and
versions of SBML that no longer apply.

\emph{(Forthcoming.)}
