\section{Proposed syntax and semantics}
\label{syntax}

In this section, we define the syntax and semantics of the Flux Balance
Constraints package for SBML Level~3 Version~1.  We expound on the various
data types and constructs defined in this package, then in \sect{examples},
we provide complete examples of using the constructs in an example SBML
model.

\subsection{Namespace URI and other declarations necessary for using this
package}
\label{xml-namespace}

Every SBML Level~3 package is identified uniquely by an XML namespace URI.
For an SBML document to be able to use a given SBML Level~3 package, it
must declare the use of that package by referencing its URI.  The following
is the namespace URI for this version of the Flux Balance Constraints
package for SBML Level~3 Version~1:
\begin{center}
\uri{http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/fbc/version2}
\end{center}

In addition, SBML documents using a given package must indicate whether
understanding the package is required for complete mathematical interpretation
of a model, or whether the package is optional.  This is done using the
attribute \token{required} on the \token{<sbml>} element in the SBML document.
For the \FBCPackage, the value of this attribute must be set to \val{false}.

The following fragment illustrates the beginning of a typical SBML model
using SBML Level~3 Version~1 and this version of the Flux Balance
Constraints package:

\begin{example}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core" level="3" version="1"
   xmlns:fbc="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/fbc/version2" fbc:required="false">
\end{example}

	\Annotation's. See \ref{conventions} for conventions related to this figure.
	The individual classes are further discussed in the text.}
  \label{fig:fbc_uml}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Primitive data types}
\label{primtypes}

Section~3.1 of the \sbmlthreecore specification defines a number of primitive
data types and also uses a number of XML Schema 1.0 data types~\citep{biron:2000}.
More specifically we make use of \primtype{integer}, \primtype{double},
\primtype{string}, \primtype{SId} and \primtype{SIdRef}. In addition we make
use of a new primitive: the enumeration \primtype{FbcType}, see \ref{fig:fbc_uml}
for the interrelation between
these entities.

The \primtype{SId} type is used as the data type for the identifiers of
\GeneProduct (\ref{geneproduct-class}) \FluxBound (\ref{fluxbound-class}), 
\FluxObjective (\ref{fluxobjective-class}) and \Objective (\ref{objective-class}) 
classes. In the FBC package the
\ListOfObjectives has an attribute of type \primtype{SIdRef} that is used to
refer to an `active' \Objective.

%\subsubsection{Type \primtypeNC{FbcSId}}
%\label{primtype-fbcsid}
%
%The type \primtype{FbcSId} is derived from \primtype{SId} (\sbmlthreecore
%specification Section~3.1.7) and has identical syntax. The \primtype{FbcSId}
%type is used as the data type for the identifiers of \FluxBound
%(\ref{fluxbound-class}), \FluxObjective (\ref{fluxobjective-class}) and \Objective (\ref{objective-class}) classes. By
%using a separate identifier type we differentiate them from others defined
%in the \SBML model and thus ensuring data encapsulation.
%The equality of \primtype{FbcSId} values is determined by an exact character sequence match and therefore comparisons of these identifiers must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.

%\subsubsection{Type \primtypeNC{FbcSIdRef}}
%\label{primtype-fbcsidref}
%
%Type \primtype{FbcSIdRef} is used for all attributes that refer to identifiers of type \primtype{FbcSId}.  Derived from \primtype{FbcSId} it has the restriction that the value of an attribute having type \primtype{FbcSIdRef} must match the value of a \primtype{FbcSId} attribute in the current model. In the FBC package the \ListOfObjectives has an attribute of this type that is used to refer to an
%`active' \Objective.

\subsubsection{Type \primtypeNC{FbcType}}
\label{primtype-fbctype}

The \FBCPackage defines a new enumerated type \primtype{FbcType} which
represents the optimization sense of the objective function. It can have one
of the following two values \val{maximize} or \val{minimize}.

\newpage
\subsection{The extended \class{Model} class}
\label{model-class}
\label{listoffluxbounds-class}
\label{listofobjectives-class}
\label{listofgeneproducts-class}

The \SBML \Model class is extended by adding an optional \token{listOfFluxBounds},
 \token{listOfObjectives} as well as a \token{listOfGeneProducts}.  A \Model may contain at most one of
each of these lists.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
  \includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/v3harmony_fbc_model.pdf}\\
  \caption{A UML representation of the extended \SBML \Model class used in
  the \FBCPackage. See \ref{conventions} for conventions related to this
  figure.}
  \label{fig:fbc_uml_model}
\end{figure}


\begin{deprecated}
\subsubsection{The \FBC \class{listOfFluxBounds}}

As shown in \ref{fig:fbc_uml} the \ListOfFluxBounds is derived from \SBase
and inherits the attributes \token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as
the subcomponents for \Annotation and \Notes. \ListOfFluxBounds must contain
at least one \FluxBound (defined in \ref{fluxbound-class}).
\end{deprecated}

\subsubsection{The \FBC \class{listOfObjectives}}

As shown in \ref{fig:fbc_uml} the \ListOfObjectives is derived from \SBase
and inherits the attributes \token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as
the subcomponents for \Annotation and \Notes. Unlike most other \SBML
\textsf{\textbf{ListOf\rule{0.15in}{0.5pt}}} classes, \ListOfObjectives
introduces an additional required attribute \token{activeObjective}. The
\ListOfObjectives must contain at least one \Objective (defined in
\ref{objective-class}).

\paragraph{The \token{activeObjective} attribute}
\label{activeObjective-attribute}

This attribute is of type \primtype{SIdRef} and can only refer to the
\token{id} of an existing \Objective. This required attribute exists
so that when multiple \Objective's are included in a single model, the
model will always be well described i.e., there is a single, primary
objective function which defines a single optimum and its associated
solution space.
\begin{newsection}
\subsubsection{The \FBC \class{listOfGeneProducts}}

As shown in \ref{fig:fbc_uml} the \ListOfGeneProducts is derived from \SBase
and inherits the attributes \token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as
the subcomponents for \Annotation and \Notes. The \ListOfGeneProducts must
contain at least one \GeneProduct (defined in \ref{geneproduct-class}).
\end{newsection}

\subsubsection{A note on units}
\label{fbcunits}
The main unit definitions that should be considered when using the \FBCPackage
are the global model definitions of ``extent''  and ``time'' as all \FBC flux
related classes (i.e., \FluxBound and \FluxObjective implicitly attain the same
unit as the \Reaction that they reference). More details on units can be found
in their respective class definitions.

\subsection{The extended \class{Species} class}
\label{species-class}

The \FBCPackage extends the \sbmlthreecore \Species class with the addition
of two attributes \token{charge} and \token{chemicalFormula}.
%
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
  \includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/v2harmony_fbc_species.pdf}\\
  \caption{A UML representation of the extended \SBML \Species class used in
  the \FBCPackage. See \ref{conventions} for conventions related to this
  figure.}
  \label{fig:fbc_uml_species}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{The \token{charge} attribute}
The optional attribute \token{charge} which contains a signed
\primtype{integer} referring to the \Species object's charge and is
defined as it was in the \SBML Level 2 Version 1 specification
: \textit{``The optional field charge takes an integer indicating
the charge on the species (in terms of electrons, not the SI unit coulombs).''}

\paragraph{The \token{chemicalFormula} attribute}
\label{chemicalFormula-attribute}
The optional attribute \token{chemicalFormula} containing a
\primtype{string} that represents the \Species objects elemental
composition.
%
\exampleFile{examples/ex_spec_l3.txt}
%
While there are many ways of referring to an elemental composition the purpose
of the \token{chemicalFormula} attribute is to allow reaction balancing and
validation which is particularly important in constraint based models.

The format of \token{chemicalFormula} must consist only of atomic names (as in
the Periodic Table) or user defined compounds either of which take the form of
a single capital letter followed by zero or more lowercase letters. Where there
is more than a single atom present, this is indicated with an integer. With
regards to order (and enhance inter-operability) it is recommended to use the
Hill system order \citep{hillsystem, hillwikipedia}.

%
\begin{table}[h!]
  %\centering
  H2O4S\qquad C2H5Br\qquad BrH\\
  C10H12N5O13P3\qquad CH3I\\
  \caption{Examples of chemical formulas written using the Hill System. As
	described in \ref{chemicalFormula-attribute}}\label{table:hill}
\end{table}
%
Using this notation the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated
first, followed by the number of hydrogen atoms and then the number of all
other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no
carbon; all elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

\begin{newsection}
\subsection{The \FBC \class{GeneProduct} class}
\label{geneproduct-class}
\GeneProduct is a new \FBC class derived from \SBML \SBase that inherits
\token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as the subcomponents for
\Annotation and \Notes. The purpose of this class is to define a single gene
product. It implements two required attributes \token{id} and \token{label} as
well as two optional attributes \token{name} and \token{associatedSpecies}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
  \includegraphics[width=5cm]{images/v2harmony_fbc_geneproduct.pdf}\\
  \caption{A UML representation of the \FBCPackage \GeneProduct class. See
  \ref{conventions} for conventions related to this figure.}
  \label{fig:fbc_uml_geneproduct}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}
A \GeneProduct has a required attribute \token{id} of type \primtype{SId} and an
optional attribute \token{name} of type \primtype{string}. The \token{id}
attribute is used to uniquely identify a \GeneProduct from a \GeneProductRef.

\paragraph{The \token{label} attribute}
The primary purpose of a \GeneProduct is to reference a gene product uniquely.
As these constructs do not follow the SId syntax, the required attribute
\token{label} of type \primtype{string} is to be used to refer to them.

%as seen in the example shown in \ref{intro-ga}
There is no set format for this identifier e.g.~\verb+Rv0649+, \verb+3074.1+ or \verb+CRv4_Au5.s2.g9153.t1+. While ideally some form of restriction should be placed on the value of \token{label}, at this point it is left as a best practice suggestion that this attribute's value conform to the definition of an \primtype{SId}. As an example take an existing GPR annotation:
\begin{verbatim}
 <p>GENE_ASSOCIATION: (Rv0649)</p>
\end{verbatim}
%
this can now be formally (and unambiguously) encoded as:
%
\exampleFile{examples/v2harmony-spec-example1-gene.txt}


\paragraph{The \token{associatedSpecies} attribute}
A \GeneProduct may optionally refer to a \Species as used for example in the
Manchester encoding. In that case the attribute \token{associatedSpecies} of
type \primtype{SIdRef} is to be used to point to an existing \Species in the
model.

\end{newsection}

\begin{deprecated}
\subsection{The \FBC \class{FluxBound} class}
\label{fluxbound-class}

\FluxBound is a new \FBC class derived from \SBML \SBase that inherits
\token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as the subcomponents for
\Annotation and \Notes. The purpose of this class is to hold a single
(in)equality that provides the maximum or minimum value that a reaction flux
can obtain at steady state. It implements three attributes.

\newtxt{ Starting with Version~2 of the Flux Balance Constraints package the 
\FluxBound construct is deprecated. This is done to ease adoption and ensure that 
not all tools have to immediately implement support for changing flux bounds the 
attributes may also refer to the an existing \FluxBound in the model. However, 
that construct is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of this 
package. }

  \includegraphics[width=5cm]{images/v2harmony_fbc_fluxbound.pdf}\\
  \caption{A UML representation of the \FBCPackage \FluxBound class. See
  \ref{conventions} for conventions related to this figure.}
  \label{fig:fbc_uml_fbnd}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}
A \FluxBound has the required attributes: \token{id} an attribute of type
\primtype{SId} and an optional attribute \token{name} an attribute of type
\primtype{string}.

\paragraph{The \token{value} attribute}
The \token{value} attribute holds a \primtype{double} value representing the
numerical value of the flux bound. This may include an explicitly defined
$\pm\infty$ encoded as a value, e.g., \val{INF}.

For an example of the how the \FluxBound relates to the description of the
underlying mathematical model please see \ref{examples1:fluxbound}.

\paragraph{Units}
The \token{value} defined by the \FluxBound has the units of the \token{reaction}
that it refers to i.e.,~the globally defined unit of ``extent per time.''

\paragraph{Reactions with undefined flux bounds}
In the spirit of \sbmlthreecore the \FBCPackage does not define any default
values for any element. However, in the case of a reaction with no defined
flux bounds it is possible to infer this information from the reaction
reversibility. In this case: irreversible reactions should be considered to
be positive, $0 <= J <= \infty$ and reversible ones free/unbound,
$-\infty <= J <= \infty$.

Similarly, there is also the potential for a bound to ``seemingly'' conflict
with the reaction that it bounds' reversibility, e.g., a reaction is
irreversible but has bounds $-\infty <= J <= \infty$. In the context of
this package, flux bounds should be considered authoritative. This follows
from the fact that a \FluxBound can enforce an irreversible reaction, by
restricting the flux ($0 <= J <= \infty$), as well as a reversible
reaction ($-\infty <= J <= \infty$). It is left to the software
implementation to deal with any obvious inconsistencies.

\end{deprecated}

%\newpage

\subsection{The \FBC \class{Objective} class}
\label{objective-class}
\label{listoffluxobjectives-class}

The \FBC \Objective class is derived from \SBML \SBase and inherits
\token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as the subcomponents for
\Annotation and \Notes. An integral component in a complete description
of a steady-state model is the so-called `objective function' which generally
consist of a linear combination of model variables (fluxes) and a sense
(direction). In the \FBC package this concept is succinctly captured in the
\Objective class.

\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}
An \Objective has a required attribute \token{id} of type
\primtype{SId} and an optional attribute \token{name} of type \primtype{string}.

\paragraph{The \token{type} attribute}
The required \token{type} attribute contains an \primtype{FbcType} type
which represents the sense of the optimality constraint and can take one of
two values:
\begin{eqnarray*}
% I'm using \mapsto until I can find the proper symbol - bgoli
\label{obj-type-enum}
 \nonumber
  maximize & \mapsto & \textrm{``}\mathtt{maximize}\textrm{''}\\
  minimize & \mapsto & \textrm{``}\mathtt{minimize}\textrm{''}
\end{eqnarray*}

\paragraph{The \token{listOfFluxObjectives} element}
The element \token{listOfFluxObjectives} which contains a
\ListOfFluxObjectives is derived from and functions like a typical \SBML
\textsf{\textbf{ListOf\rule{0.15in}{0.5pt}}} class with the restriction that it
must contain one or more elements of type \FluxObjective (see \ref{fluxobjective-class}).
This implies that if an \Objective is defined there should be at least
one \FluxObjective contained in a \ListOfFluxObjectives.
% bgoli: to me this makes sense but are there other examples of this in SBML or is everything always optional

  \caption{A UML representation of the \FBCPackage \Objective class. See
  \ref{conventions} for conventions related to this figure.}
  \label{fig:fbc_uml_obj}
\end{figure}

\pagebreak
\paragraph{Encoding the \Objective}
The \FBCPackage allows for the definition of multiple model objectives with
one being designated as active (see \ref{objective-class}) as illustrated in
this example:
%
\exampleFile{examples/ex_objf_fbc.txt}
%
Note how both \Objective instances differ in \token{type} and each contains
different set of \class{FluxObjectives} (see \ref{fluxobjective-class}).
For an example of how the \Objective relates to the description of the
underlying mathematical model please see \ref{examples1:objfunc}.

\subsection{The \FBC \class{FluxObjective} class}
\label{fluxobjective-class}

The \FBC \FluxObjective class is derived from \SBML \SBase and inherits
\token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as the subcomponents for
\Annotation and \Notes.

The \FluxObjective class is a relatively simple container for a model
variable weighted by a signed linear coefficient.

  \caption{A UML representation of the \FBCPackage \FluxObjective class. See
  \ref{conventions} for conventions related to this figure.}
  \label{fig:fbc_uml_fobj}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}
A \FluxObjective has two optional attributes: \token{id} an attribute of
type \primtype{SId} and \token{name} an attribute of type \primtype{string}.

\pagebreak
\paragraph{The \token{reaction} and \token{coefficient} attributes}
The required \token{reaction} is of type \primtype{SIdRef} and is restricted
to refer only to a \Reaction while the \token{coefficient} attribute
holds a \primtype{double} referring to the coefficient that this \FluxObjective
takes in the enclosing \Objective. For example the objective
\texttt{ Maximize: 1 R1 + 2 R2} would be encoded as
%
\exampleFile{examples/ex_fluxobj_fbc.txt}


\paragraph{Units}
As described above the \FluxObjective defined here as $n\cdot J$ where
the \token{coefficient} ($n$) is dimensionless and the \token{value} ($J$)
takes the units of the \token{reaction} flux i.e.,~``extent per time''.
Therefore, the \FluxObjective ($n\cdot J$)  has the unit ``extent per time''
where the units of reaction ``extent'' and ``time'' are defined globally.
