\begin{quote}
 \textbf{\Large The contents of this section are a combination of discussion on the FBC PWG mailing list and discussions at HARMONY 2018 held in Oxford.}
\end{quote}

The proposed \FBCPackage version~3 extends the definition of the \FluxObjective, extends the definition of the \token{chemicalFormula}, defines a \UserConstraint and adds a generic \KeyValuePair annotation.

\subsubsection{Type \primtypeNC{FbcVariableType}}
\label{primtype-fbcvariabletype}

The \FBCPackage defines a new enumerated type \primtype{FbcVariableType} which
represents the index of a variable that occurs in either the \FluxObjective or \UserConstraintComponent. It contains the following two values, \val{linear} or \val{quadratic}.


%\subsubsection{Type \primtypeNC{FbcUCCVariableType}}
%\label{primtype-fbcuserconstraintvariabletype}
%
%The \FBCPackage defines a new enumerated type \primtype{FbcUCCVariableType} which
%represents the index of a variable that occurs in a user defined constraint. It can have one
%of the following two values \val{linear} or \val{quadratic}.

\subsubsection{The \FBC \class{listOfUserConstraints}}
\label{listofuserconstraints-class}

As shown in \ref{fig:fbc_v3_uml_user_constraints} the \ListOfUserConstraints is derived from \SBase and inherits the attributes \token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as
the subcomponents for \Annotation and \Notes. The \ListOfUserConstraints must contain at least one \UserConstraint (defined in \ref{userconstraint-class}).

\subsection{The extended \class{Species} class}

\paragraph{The \token{chemicalFormula} attribute}
\label{chemicalFormula-attribute}

The optional attribute \token{chemicalFormula} containing a \primtype{string} that represents the \Species objects elemental composition.
%
\exampleFile{examples/ex-v3-species.txt}
%
\newtxt{While there are many ways of referring to an elemental composition, the purpose of the \token{chemicalFormula} attribute is to enable reaction balancing and validation, something of particular importance in constraint-based models.}

\newtxt{The format of the \token{chemicalFormula} should, whenever possible, consist only of atomic names
(as in the Periodic Table). Similarly, for enhanced inter-operability, the element order should be arranged according to the Hill system} \citep{hillsystem, hillwikipedia}.
%
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    % after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
     $H_{2}O_{4}S$ & $C_{2}H_{5}Br$ & $BrH$ \\
     $C_{10}H_{12}N_{5}O_{13}P_{3}$ & $CH_{3}I$ & $CH_{4}$  \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Examples of chemical formulas written using the Hill System. As
	described in \ref{chemicalFormula-attribute}}\label{table:hill}
\end{table}
%
\newtxt{Using this notation the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, followed by the number of hydrogen atoms and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon; all elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Where there is more than a single atom present, this is indicated with an integer that follows the element symbol.}

\newtxt{However, in certain situations it does become necessary to use a generic symbol in a user defined compound. For example, such symbols can include \textsf{R} and \textsf{X} and have the general form of a single capital letter followed by zero or more lowercase letters.}
%
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    % after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
     $RCONH_{2}$ & $RCOX$ & $C_{2}H_{4}O_{2}(CH_{2})_{n}$ \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Examples of chemical formulas written using allowed non-Hill symbols, as described in \ref{chemicalFormula-attribute}.}\label{table:non-hill}
\end{table}
%
\newtxt{In addition, the undefined parenthesised group index $(\ldots)_n$ may also be used. Note that in this case only the subscript $n$ is allowed, integer values $(\ldots)_2$ and expressions such as $(\ldots)_{n-1}$ are considered invalid.}

\newtxt{However, the use of \textsf{R}, \textsf{X} and $(\ldots)_n$ is not advised, as any \Reaction in which such a \Species occurs cannot necessarily be balanced. Therefore, any \token{chemicalFormula} that contains any of the aforementioned, non-Hill compatible symbols will raise a `best practices' warning on model validation.}

\subsection{The \FBC \class{FluxObjective} class}

The \FBC \FluxObjective class is derived from \SBML \SBase and inherits
\token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as the subcomponents for
\Annotation and \Notes.
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
  \includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/fbc_v3_uml_fobj.pdf}\\
  \caption{A UML representation of the \FBCPackage \FluxObjective class. For a complete description see \ref{fig:fbc_uml} as well as \ref{conventions} for conventions related to this figure.}
  \label{fig:fbc_uml_userconstraint}
\end{figure}
%
The \FluxObjective class is a relatively simple container for a model
variable that can be expressed as a `linear' or `quadratic', weighted by a signed linear coefficient.

\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}
A \FluxObjective has two optional attributes: \token{id} an attribute of
type \primtype{SId} and \token{name} an attribute of type \primtype{string}.

\paragraph{The \token{reaction} and \token{coefficient} attributes}
The required \token{reaction} is of type \primtype{SIdRef} and is restricted
to refer only to a \Reaction while the \token{coefficient} attribute
holds a \primtype{double} referring to the coefficient that this \FluxObjective
takes in the enclosing \Objective.

\newtxt{\paragraph{The \token{variableType} attribute}
The required \token{variableType} attribute contains a \primtype{FbcVariableType} that
represents the index to which a variable is raised in a \FluxObjective. For example, where $J_{x}$ represents a steady-state flux the \primtype{FbcVariableType} defines either a \val{linear}, $J^1_x$ or \val{quadratic}, $J^2_x$ term.}

\paragraph{Flux objectives: example code}
\newtxt{An objective with purely linear terms in LP format:} \verb"Maximize: 1 R1 + 2 R2"
%
\exampleFile{examples/ex-v3-fluxobjective-linear.txt}
%
\newtxt{Similarly, an objective with a quadratic term in LP format:} \verb"Minimize: 1 R1 + [4 R2^2]/2"
%
\exampleFile{examples/ex-v3-fluxobjective.txt}

\paragraph{Units}
As described above the linear \FluxObjective defined here as $n\cdot J$ where
the \token{coefficient} ($n$) is dimensionless and the \token{value} ($J$)
takes the units of the \token{reaction} flux i.e.,~``extent per time''.
Therefore, the linear \FluxObjective ($n\cdot J$)  has the unit ``extent per time''
where the units of reaction ``extent'' and ``time'' are defined globally. In the case of a quadratic objective $n\cdot J^{2}$ this would be ``extent per time squared.''



\subsection{The \FBC \class{UserConstraint} class}
\label{userconstraint-class}

The \FBC \UserConstraint class is derived from \SBML \SBase and inherits
\token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as the subcomponents for
\Annotation and \Notes. It's purpose is to define non-stoichiometric constraints, that is  constraints that are not necessarily defined by the stoichiometrically coupled reaction network. In order to achieve we defined a new type of linear constraint, the \UserConstraint.

Analogous to the attributes described in \ref{reaction-class-ga} the \token{lowerBound} and \token{upperBound} form the boundaries of the \UserConstraint.
%
\begin{eqnarray}
% \nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation)
  \UserConstraint &=& \token{value} \\
  \UserConstraint &\geq& \token{lowerFluxBound value} \\
  \UserConstraint &\leq& \token{upperFluxBound value}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Defining either an equality if both \token{lowerBound} and \token{upperBound} refere to the same parameter (Equation~4) or set of inequalities (Equations 4 and 5).

The \UserConstraint contains a \ListOfUserConstraintComponents representing a linear combination of \UserConstraintComponent{s}. Similar to a \FluxObjective each \UserConstraintComponent contains a coefficient--variable pair where the \token{coefficient} refers to a \Parameter. In addition to a \Reaction a \UserConstraintComponent allows the \token{variable} to refer to non-constant \Parameter thus allowing the definition of non-reaction, artificial, variables.

\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}
A \UserConstraint has an optional \token{id} of type
\primtype{SId} and an optional attribute \token{name} of type \primtype{string}.

\paragraph{The \token{lowerBound} attribute}
The required \token{lowerBound} attribute contains an \primtype{SIdRef} that references a \Parameter which contains the lower boundary value of the \UserConstraint.

\paragraph{The \token{upperBound} attribute}
The required \token{upperBound} attribute contains an \primtype{SIdRef} that references a \Parameter which contains the upper boundary value of the \UserConstraint.

\paragraph{The \token{listOfUserConstraintComponents} element}
\label{listofuserconstraintcomponents-class}

The element \token{listOfUserConstraintComponents} which contains a
\ListOfUserConstraintComponents is derived from and functions like a typical \SBML
\textsf{\textbf{ListOf\rule{0.15in}{0.5pt}}} class with the restriction that it
must contain one or more elements of type \UserConstraintComponent (see \ref{userconstraintcomponent-class}).
This implies that if a \UserConstraint is defined there should be at least
one \UserConstraintComponent contained in a \ListOfUserConstraintComponents.

\subsection{The \FBC \class{UserConstraintComponent} class}
\label{userconstraintcomponent-class}

The \FBC \UserConstraintComponent class is derived from \SBML \SBase and inherits
\token{metaid} and \token{sboTerm}, as well as the subcomponents for
\Annotation and \Notes. The \UserConstraintComponent class is a relatively simple container for a variable and a variable type specifier which is weighted by a signed coefficient.

\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}
An \UserConstraintComponent has an optional \token{id} of type \primtype{SId} and an optional attribute \token{name} of type \primtype{string}.

\paragraph{The \token{coefficient} attribute}
The required \token{coefficient} attribute contains an \primtype{SIdRef} that is restricted to reference only a constant \Parameter which holds the coefficient value. (\newtxt{In \textbf{strict} mode a \Parameter whose \primtype{SId} is referenced by a \token{coefficient}, as in the case of a \FluxObjective \token{coefficient}, has to be constant and not take the value NaN or $\pm$inf}).

\paragraph{The \token{variable} attribute}
\newtxt{The required \token{variable} attribute contains an \primtype{SIdRef} that is restricted to reference the \primtype{SId} of either a \Reaction or a non-constant \Parameter. Conversely, if such non-constant \Parameter's \primtype{SId} is referenced by a \UserConstraintComponent's \token{variable} attribute it may not be referenced by any \token{coefficient}, \token{lowerFluxBound} or \token{upperFluxBound} attribute.}

\paragraph{The \token{variableType} attribute}
The required \token{variableType} attribute contains a \primtype{FbcVariableType} that indicates whether a variable should be considered as `linear' or `quadratic'.

\paragraph{User constraints: example code}
The following example illustrates the encoding of the following two \UserConstraint{s}:
\begin{eqnarray}
% \nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation)
  RGLX - RXLG  &=& 5 \\
  2\cdot Avar - RGDP &\geq& 2
\end{eqnarray}
\exampleFile{examples/ex-v3-userconstraints.txt}





\subsection{The \FBC \class{ListOfKeyValuePairs} class}
\label{listofkeyvaluepairs-class}

The \ListOfKeyValuePairs, see \ref{fig:fbc_v3_uml_keyvalue} for details, forms the basis of a controlled annotation defined by the \FBCPackage. This element defines a `structured note' or `descriptive list' of keys and associated values.
%
\exampleFile{examples/ex-v3-kvp1.txt}
%
As such it is analogous to the official \SBML RDF annotation used to support MIRIAM annotations, as defined in the \SBML specification documents. When an annotation that declares the \token{xmlns} \token{http://sbml.org/fbc/keyvaluepair} then it must have the format specified here. Tools may chose to support reading and interpreting the content as described, but may optionally ignore the annotation and merely round trip it with any other third party annotations. As is the case with the RDF/MIRIAM annotations, support for \ListOfKeyValuePairs will be included in the \SBML support libraries.

  \label{fig:fbc_v3_uml_keyvalue}
\end{figure}
%
\newtxt{The \ListOfKeyValuePairs functions like a typical \SBML \textsf{\textbf{ListOf\rule{0.15in}{0.5pt}}} class with the restriction that it must contain one or more elements of type \KeyValuePair (see \ref{keyvaluepair-class}). In addition it defines a single mandatory attribute, \token{xmlns}, which identifies the annotation as belonging to the \FBCPackage.}

\paragraph{The \token{xmlns} attribute}
The \token{xmlns} is a mandatory component of the \ListOfKeyValuePairs, is of the type \primtype{uri} and must have the value \token{http://sbml.org/fbc/keyvaluepair}.


\subsection{The \FBC \class{KeyValuePair} class}
\label{keyvaluepair-class}

\newtxt{The \FBC \KeyValuePair class is derived from \SBase and inherits the attribute \token{metaid},  \token{sboTerm} as well as the subcomponents needed for \Notes \marginpar{\textbf{\footnotesize I've purposely left out Annotation, BGO.}}. It's sole purpose is to define a key--value pair with an extended key definition.}

The \KeyValuePair defines a single mandatory attribute the \token{key} as well as \newtxt{two optional attributes: \token{value} and \token{uri}}.

\paragraph{The \token{id} and \token{name} attributes}
A \KeyValuePair has two optional attributes: \token{id} an attribute of
type \primtype{SId} and \token{name}, an attribute of type \primtype{string}.

\paragraph{The \token{key} attribute}
The \token{key} is the mandatory component of the \KeyValuePair pair and is of type \primtype{string}. It has the special property that every \token{key} in an enclosing \ListOfKeyValuePairs must be unique.

\paragraph{The \token{value} attribute}
The optional \token{value} attribute is of \primtype{string} and contains the value associated with a particular \token{key}. If not present, the \KeyValuePair is defined to have no value.

\paragraph{The \token{uri} attribute}
\newtxt{The optional attribute \token{uri} is of type \primtype{uri}. This attribute is included and references a resource that contains a description of the \token{key} component of the \KeyValuePair. Note that the nature or structure of this resource is not defined. For example, it could be an HTML page with a textual description of the \token{key}(s) used by a particular tool or another that contains a table of key definitions\footnote{\url{http://bgoli.net/kvp/spec_example.html} (Temporary, will change.)}.}

However, the concomitant development of a central \token{key} resource and associated standardised \token{key} definition would enable greater model reusability and tool interoperability and be of benefit to the broader \SBML community.
