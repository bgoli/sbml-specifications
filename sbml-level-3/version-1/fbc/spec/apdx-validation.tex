\section{Validation of SBML documents}
\label{apdx-validation}

\subsection{Validation and consistency rules}
\label{validation-rules}

This section summarizes all the conditions that must (or in some cases,
at least \emph{should}) be true of an SBML Level~3 Version~1 model that
uses the \FBC Package. We use the same conventions as
are used in the SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core specification document. In
particular, there are different degrees of rule strictness. Formally,
the differences are expressed in the statement of a rule: either a rule
states that a condition \emph{must} be true, or a rule states that it
\emph{should} be true. Rules of the former kind are strict SBML
validation rules---a model encoded in SBML must conform to all of them
in order to be considered valid. Rules of the latter kind are
consistency rules. To help highlight these differences, we use the
following three symbols next to the rule numbers:

\begin{description}

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\vSymbol\vsp] A \vSymbolName indicates a
\emph{requirement} for SBML conformance. If a model does not follow this
rule, it does not conform to the \FBC Package
specification. (Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol: ``This
must be checked.'')

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\cSymbol\csp] A \cSymbolName indicates a
\emph{recommendation} for model consistency. If a model does not follow
this rule, it is not considered strictly invalid as far as the
\FBC Package specification is concerned; however, it
indicates that the model contains a physical or conceptual
inconsistency. (Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol: ``This
is a cause for warning.'')

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\mSymbol\msp] A \mSymbolName indicates a strong
recommendation for good modeling practice. This rule is not strictly a
matter of SBML encoding, but the recommendation comes from logical
reasoning. As in the previous case, if a model does not follow this
rule, it is not strictly considered an invalid SBML encoding. (Mnemonic
intention behind the choice of symbol: ``You're a star if you heed
this.'')

\end{description}

The validation rules listed in the following subsections are all stated
or implied in the rest of this specification document. They are
enumerated here for convenience. Unless explicitly stated, all
validation rules concern objects and attributes specifically defined in
the \FBC Package package.

For \notice convenience and brevity, we use the shorthand
``\token{fbc:\-x}'' to stand for an attribute or element name \token{x}
in the namespace for the \FBC Package package, using
the namespace prefix \token{fbc}. In reality, the prefix string may be
different from the literal ``\token{fbc}'' used here (and indeed, it can
be any valid XML namespace prefix that the modeler or software chooses).
We use ``\token{fbc:\-x}'' because it is shorter than to write a full
explanation everywhere we refer to an attribute or element in the
\FBC Package namespace.

\subsubsection*{General rules about this package}

\validRule{fbc-10101}{To conform to the \FBC Package
specification for SBML Level~3 Version~1, an SBML document must declare
\uri{http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/fbc/version3} as the
XMLNamespace to use for elements of this package. (Reference: SBML
Level~3 Specification for Flux Balance Constraints, Version~3
\sec{xml-namespace}.)}

\validRule{fbc-10102}{Wherever they appear in an SBML document, elements
and attributes from the \FBC Package must use the
\uri{http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/fbc/version3} namespace,
declaring so either explicitly or implicitly. (Reference: SBML Level~3
Specification for Flux Balance Constraints, Version~3
\sec{xml-namespace}.)}

\subsubsection*{General rules about identifiers}

\validRule{fbc-10301}{(Extends validation rule \#10301 in the

following classes of objects must be unique across the set of all
\token{id} and \token{fbc:\-id} attribute values of all such objects in
a model: the \Model itself, plus all contained \FunctionDefinition,
\Compartment, \Species, \Reaction, \SpeciesReference,
\ModifierSpeciesReference, \Event, and \Parameter objects, plus the
\GeneProduct, %\FluxBound,
\Objective, \FluxObjective, \GeneProductAssociation, \UserDefinedConstraint and
