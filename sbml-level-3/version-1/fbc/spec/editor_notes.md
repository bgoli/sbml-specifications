# FBC3: editor notes

## Questions

### How does "strict" interact with FBC3? (Page8)
For example should we restrict the use of InitialAssignments to FBC3 referrenced paramaters?
The alternative (my preferenance) is to say that strict refers to the core model and for the FBC3 advanced features
anything goes.
