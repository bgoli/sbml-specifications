\section{Best practices}
\label{best-practices}

In this section, we recommend a number of practices for using and
interpreting various constructs in the Flux Balance Constraints package.
These recommendations are non-normative, but we advocate them strongly;
ignoring them will not render a model invalid, but may reduce
interoperability between software and models.
