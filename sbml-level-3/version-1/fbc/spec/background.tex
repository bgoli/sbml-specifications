\section{Background}

\subsection{Problems with current SBML approaches}

While there is currently no official way of encoding constraint-based models
in SBML L2 there have been pragmatic approaches used by a variety of groups
and applications. Arguably the most comprehensive and widely used format is
that used by the \textsf{COBRA toolbox}~\citep{cobra} where the metabolic
reaction network is well defined using SBML's \Reaction and \Species
classes. However, other FBA specific model components such as flux bounds
and the reactions that take part in the objective function are less well
defined. For example, in this case \LocalParameter elements are used which (implicitly) rely on all tools knowing and using the same naming convention for the parameter \token{id's}. Furthermore, reaction annotations are generally stored as tool specific HTML key-value pairs in a \Notes element which has routinely
led to different research groups and software using in-house and/or tool
specific ways to describe the same information.
%
An example of such an annotation is the widely used `gene protein association'.
%
While a step in the right direction, this encoding is not suitable for
direct translation into SBML Level~3.

It is perhaps worth noting \newtxt{that,} while SBML~Level~2 does have a construct known as \Constraint, its function \newtxt{is} traditionally limited to measuring and reporting a model \newtxt{variable's} behavior in time. In contrast, the \FBCPackage considers a model at steady state and therefore time invariant. Instead it makes use of \Parameter elements to define the allowable range that a steady-state flux may attain. Therefore `flux bounds' and \Constraint elements should be considered complementary to one another.
%In contrast the %\FluxBound
%\Parameter elements referenced via \token{fbc:lowerFluxBound} and \token{fbc:upperFluxBound} enforce the bounds on a steady-state flux and they can therefore be considered to be independent of one another.
%For example while a \Constraint reports behavior on a \Species during a
%dynamic time simulation and a \FluxBound determining the behavior of the
%fluxes at steady state where, by definition, the variable \Species are
%constant.
%
Furthermore, certain attributes that were widely used by the constraint-based modeling community such as the \Species attribute \token{charge} were removed in later versions of SBML. This has had the effect that a significant number of constraint-based modelling and metabolic flux analysis software still make use of SBML Level~2 Version~1.

\subsection{Past work on this problem or similar topics}
The problem of describing and annotating FBA models in SBML has been raised
at various times in the past few years. In this regard there are two known
putative proposals one by Karthik Raman and the other by the Church
Laboratory. As far as we are aware these proposals never developed beyond
their initial presentation at SBML forums/hackathons. In 2009 the discussion
was reopened at the SBML Forum held in Stanford, an initiative which has subsequently developed into the current active package proposal and this document. In reverse chronological order these are:
