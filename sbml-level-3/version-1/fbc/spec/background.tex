\subsection{ Problems with current SBML approaches }

While there is currently no official way of encoding constraint
based models in SBML L2 there have been \textit{pragmatic}
approaches used by a variety of groups and applications. Perhaps
the most widely used is that used by the COBRA toolbox

where the reaction network is defined as reactions and for e.g. the constraint-based models: the COBRA Toolbox everyone using the same parameter names to describe e.g. the upper or lower bounds. In a similar way the objective function is indicated by a local parameter having a value of one (as such it is not clear how to deal with multiple objective functions or objective functions that may contain more than one flux). While currently the most widely used way of describing GSR/constraint based models, as is, it is not suitable for implementation in SBML Level 3.

\subsection{ Past work on this problem or similar topics }
The problem of describing and annotating constraint based (or FBA) models in SBML has
been discussed on various occasions:

A pre 2005 (and presumed to be unmaintained) SBML L2 annotation is also known to exist:
