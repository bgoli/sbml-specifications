\subsection{ Problems with current SBML approaches }


While there is currently no official way of encoding constraint based models in SBML L2 there have been pragmatic approaches used by a variety of groups and applications. Arguably the best and most widely used format is that used by the \textsf{COBRA toolbox}~\citep{cobra} where the metabolic network is well defined using \SBML \Reaction and \Species objects. However, flux bounds and reactions that take part in the objective function are defined as \LocalParameter objects and (implicitly) rely on all tools using the same naming convention. Similarly, reaction annotations are generally stored as key-value pairs in HTML \Notes elements which has led to different groups routinely using different keys describing describing the same thing. While a step in the right direction this format is not suitable for implementation in \SBML Level 3.


\subsection{ Past work on this problem or similar topics }
The problem of describing and annotating `FBA' models in \SBML has been raised  at various times in the past few years. In this regard there are two known putative proposals that of Karthik Raman and the Church Laboratory. As far as we are aware these proposals never developed beyond their initial presentation.
