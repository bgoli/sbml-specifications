\abstract{Biological models often contain elements that are stochastic in nature and are based on data with uncertainty. The \emph{SBML Level 3 Core} specification does not include an explicit mechanism to include stochastic elements in the mathematics of the model, nor does it provide a way to describe the uncertainty behind its constructs, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML \emph{packages} to extend the Core specification and add additional syntactical constructs. The SBML \emph{Distributions} package for SBML Level 3 adds the necessary features to allow the encoding of models with stochastic elements, by allowing new math constructs to draw values from predefined distributions. It also allows the modeler to encode the uncertainty of observations such as the standard deviation or the range of elements in the model with mathematical meaning.}
