\abstract{Biological models often contain elements that have inexact numerical values, since they are based on values that are stochastic in nature or data that contains uncertainty. The \emph{SBML Level~3 Core} specification does not include an explicit mechanism to include inexact or stochastic values in a model, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML \emph{packages} to extend the Core specification and add additional syntactic constructs. The SBML \emph{Distributions} package for SBML Level~3 adds the necessary features to allow models to encode information about the distribution and uncertainty of values underlying a quantity.}
