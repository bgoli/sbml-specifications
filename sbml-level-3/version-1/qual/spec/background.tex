\section{Background and context}
\label{background}

After several attempts to use the existing SBML L2 format, a decision was made to develop an extension for SBML L3.
A first proposal written in August 2008 by Duncan Berenguier and Nicolas Le Nov\`ere was discussed during a meeting on the 12th and 13th of August 2008\footnote{Nicolas Le Nov\`ere (\href{http://www.sbml.org}{SBML}), Sarah Keating (SBML), Nicolas	Rodriguez (SBML), Denis Thieffry (\href{http://gin.univ-mrs.fr/}{GINsim}), Duncan Berenguier (GINsim), Aur\'elien Naldi (GINsim), Claudine Chaouiya (GINsim, Petri nets), Tomas Helikar (\href{http://www.bioinformatics.org/chemchains/wiki/}{Chemchains}), Ioannis Xenarios (\href{http://www.enfin.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=squad:start}{SQUAD}), Alessandro Di Cara (SQUAD), Mathias John (\href{http://piml.sourceforge.net/}{PiML}), Dagmar Koehn (PiML)}. 
%The previous proposal is available at \url{http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur/xwiki/bin/download/SBML/L3F/L3F_extension_draft_1.1.pdf}.
This meeting led to the release of a document (L3F\_extention\_draft\_1.2.pdf) which is a revision of a previous proposal for this package. A summary of the meeting is available at \url{http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur/xwiki/bin/view/SBML/L3F}, and a document

A second meeting was held at in November 2010 (see \url{http://compbio.igc.gulbenkian.pt/nmd/node/30}, for the program and participants). A revised version of the proposal was discussed during this meeting.
This document accounts for the outcomes of the meeting discussions and of following exchanges.
