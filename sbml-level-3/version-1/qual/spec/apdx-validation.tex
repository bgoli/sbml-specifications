\section{Validation of SBML documents}
\label{apdx-validation}

\subsection{Validation and consistency rules}
\label{validation-rules}

This section summarizes all the conditions that must (or in some cases,
at least \emph{should}) be true of an SBML Level~3 Version~1 model that
uses the Qualitative Models package.  We use the same
conventions as are used in the SBML Level~3 Version~1 Core specification
document.  In particular, there are different degrees of rule
strictness.  Formally, the differences are expressed in the statement of
a rule: either a rule states that a condition \emph{must} be true, or a
rule states that it \emph{should} be true.  Rules of the former kind are
strict SBML validation rules---a model encoded in SBML must conform to
all of them in order to be considered valid.  Rules of the latter kind
are consistency rules.  To help highlight these differences, we use the
following three symbols next to the rule numbers:

\begin{description}

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\vSymbol\vsp] A \vSymbolName indicates a
  \emph{requirement} for SBML conformance. If a model does not follow
  this rule, it does not conform to the Qualitative Models
  specification.  (Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol:
  ``This must be checked.'')

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\cSymbol\csp] A \cSymbolName indicates a
  \emph{recommendation} for model consistency.  If a model does not
  follow this rule, it is not considered strictly invalid as far as
  the Qualitative Models specification is concerned;
  however, it indicates that the model contains a physical or
  conceptual inconsistency.  (Mnemonic intention behind the choice of
  symbol: ``This is a cause for warning.'')

\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\mSymbol\msp] A \mSymbolName indicates a strong
  recommendation for good modeling practice.  This rule is not
  strictly a matter of SBML encoding, but the recommendation comes
  from logical reasoning.  As in the previous case, if a model does
  not follow this rule, it is not strictly considered an invalid SBML
  encoding.  (Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol: ``You're
  a star if you heed this.'')

\end{description}

The validation rules listed in the following subsections are all stated
or implied in the rest of this specification document.  They are
enumerated here for convenience.  Unless explicitly stated, all
validation rules concern objects and attributes specifically defined in
the Qualitative Models package.

For \notice convenience and brievity, we use the shorthand
``\token{qual:\-x}'' to stand for an attribute or element name \token{x}
in the namespace for the Qualitative Models package, using
the namespace prefix \token{qual}.  In reality, the prefix string may be
different from the literal ``\token{qual}'' used here (and indeed, it
can be any valid XML namespace prefix that the modeler or software
chooses).  We use ``\token{qual:\-x}'' because it is shorter than to
write a full explanation everywhere we refer to an attribute or element
in the Qualitative Models package namespace.


\subsubsection*{General rules about this package}

\validRule{qual-10101}{To conform to the Qualitative Models package specification for SBML Level~3 Version~1, an
  SBML document must declare the use of the following XML Namespace:\\
  \textls[-25]{\uri{http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/qual/version1}}.
  (References: SBML Level~3 Package Specification for Qualitative Models, Version~1, \sec{xml-namespace}.)}

\validRule{qual-10102}{Wherever they appear in an SBML document,
  elements and attributes from the Qualitative Models
  package must be declared either implicitly or explicitly to be in the
  XML namespace
  \uri{http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/comp/version1}.
  (References: SBML Level~3 Package Specification for Qualitative Models, Version~1, \sec{xml-namespace}.) }

\subsubsection*{General rules about identifiers} 

\validRule{qual-10301}{(Extends validation rule \#10301 in the SBML
  Level~3 Version~1 Core specification.) Within a \Model the values of the attributes
  \token{id} and \token{qual:\-id} on every instance of the following
  classes of objects must be unique across the set of all \token{id} and
  \token{qual:\-id} attribute values of all such objects in a model: the
  \Model itself, plus all contained \FunctionDefinition, \Compartment,
  \Species, \Reaction, \SpeciesReference, \ModifierSpeciesReference,
  \Event, and \Parameter objects, plus the \QualitativeSpecies, \Transition, 
  \Input and \Output
  objects defined by the Qualitative Models package.

\subsubsection*{Rules for the extended \class{SBML} class}
