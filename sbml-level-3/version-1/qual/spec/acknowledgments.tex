	The development of the qual SBML package has been made possible through the organization of three meetings. These were mainly supported by the EMBL-EBI, Cambridge, UK and by the IGC, Portugal. It has been boosted by the path2models projects sponsored by EMBL-EBI. Finally the authors would like to thank the members of the \textit{sbml-qual} Package Working Group and in particular A. von Kamp, S. Klamt, N. Le Nov\`ere, N. Rodriguez, J. Saez-Rodriguez and I. Xenarios who have also collaborated in this proposal.
