Dear Andrew and Drew,

I hope these files might be useful to you for thinking about expression of
complexes and such.  I'm sorry to say that the program I thought would do XML
pretty-printing didn't seem to do the job.  (I thought it indented nicely, but
it doesn't seem to after all.)  The html "display" version may be the most
useful to you.

You can see the specification of a particular complex in the
"explicit-species" section, the plex species "two-four".

An "omniplex" is a subcomplex that has been singled out by the user either
to track species of complexes that contain a particular subcomplex or to
specify that species of complexes that contain a particular subcomplex have
special properties.  See the "allosteric-omnis" section for one of these.
Some special reactions (none specified in this file) also happen to any
species of complex that has a particular, user-specified subcomplex.

If I can be of any help, please let me know.

-Larry
