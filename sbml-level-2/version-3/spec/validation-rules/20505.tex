A \Compartment may not enclose itself through a chain of references
involving the \token{outside} \changed{attribute}.  This means that a compartment cannot
have its own identifier as the value of \token{outside}, nor can it point
to another compartment whose \token{outside} \changed{attribute} points directly or
indirectly to the compartment.  (References: L2V1 erratum 11; L2V2 Section~4.7.7;
L2V3 Section~\ref{sec:compartment-outside}.)
