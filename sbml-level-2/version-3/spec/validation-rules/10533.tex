When the \token{variable} in a \RateRule definition refers to a \Parameter,
the units of the rule's right-hand side must be of the form \emph{x per
time}, where \emph{x} is the \token{units} in that \Parameter definition,
and \emph{time} refers to the units of time for the model.  (References:
L2V2 Section~4.11.4; L2V3 Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
