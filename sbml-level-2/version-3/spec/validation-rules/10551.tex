In SBML Level~2 Version~3 and later, the units of the \Event delay formula
must correspond to the model's overall units of time.  In SBML Level~2
prior to Version~3, when a value for \token{delay} is given in an \Event
definition, the units of the delay formula must correspond to either the
value of \token{timeUnits} in the \Event or (if \token{timeUnits} is not
given a value), the model's default units of time.  (References: L2V2
Section~\ref{sec:event-delay}.)
