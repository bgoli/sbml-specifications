The \token{outside} \changed{attribute} value of a \Compartment cannot be a
compartment whose \token{spatialDimensions} value is \val{0},
unless both compartments have \token{spatialDimensions}=\val{0}.
Simply put, a zero-dimensional compartment cannot enclose
compartments that have anything other than zero dimensions
themselves.  (References: L2V2 Section~4.7.7; L2V3
Section~\ref{sec:compartment-outside}.)
