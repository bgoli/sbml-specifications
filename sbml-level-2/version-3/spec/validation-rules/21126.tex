In SBML Level~2 Version~2 \changed{and later}, the time units of a reaction
rate expression are those of the global \val{time} units of the model.  The
\token{timeUnits} \changed{attribute} on \KineticLaw, previously available in SBML
Level~1 and Level~2 Version~1, has been removed as of SBML Level~2
Version~2.  (References: L2V2 Section~\ref{subsec:kinetic-law}.)
