If a \Compartment definition has a \token{spatialDimensions} value of
\val{0}, then its \token{constant} \changed{attribute} value must either default to or be
set to \val{true}.  If the compartment has no dimensions, then its size can
never change.  (References: L2V1 Section 4.5.5; L2V2
Section~\ref{sec:compartment-constant}.)
