A \Species' quantity cannot be determined simultaneously by both
reactions and rules.  More formally, if the identifier of a
\Species definition having \token{boundaryCondition}=\val{false}
and \token{constant}=\val{false} is referenced by a
\SpeciesReference anywhere in a model, then this identifier cannot
also appear as the value of a \token{variable} in an
\AssignmentRule or a \RateRule.  (References: L2V1 Section 4.6.5;
L2V2 Section~4.8.6; L2V3 Section~\ref{sec:species-constant}.)
