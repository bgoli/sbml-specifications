All species referenced in the \KineticLaw formula of a given reaction must
first be declared using \SpeciesReference or \ModifierSpeciesReference.
More formally, if a \Species identifier appears in a \token{ci} element of
a \Reaction's \KineticLaw formula, that same identifier must also appear in
at least one \SpeciesReference or \ModifierSpeciesReference in the
\Reaction definition.  (References: L2V2 Section~4.13.5; \changed{L2V3
Section~\ref{subsec:kinetic-law}.})
