The value of the \token{kind} \changed{attribute} of a \Unit can only be one of
the predefined units enumerated by \primtype{UnitKind}; that is,
the SBML unit system is not hierarchical and user-defined units
cannot be defined using other user-defined units.  (References:
L2V2 Section~\ref{sec:unit-structure}.)
