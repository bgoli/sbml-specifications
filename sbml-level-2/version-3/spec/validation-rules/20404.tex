Redefinitions of the built-in unit \token{area} must be based on squared
\token{metre}s or \token{dimensionless}.  More formally, a \UnitDefinition
for \token{area} must simplify to a single \Unit in which either (a) the
\token{kind} attribute has a value of \val{metre} and the
\token{exponent} attribute has a value of \val{2}, or (b) the
\token{kind} attribute has a value of \val{dimensionless} with
any \token{exponent} value.  (References: L2V1 Section 4.4.3; L2V2
