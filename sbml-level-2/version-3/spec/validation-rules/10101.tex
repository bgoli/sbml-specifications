An SBML XML file must use UTF-8 as the character encoding.  More
precisely, the \token{encoding} attribute of the XML declaration
at the beginning of the XML data stream cannot have a value other
than \val{UTF-8}.  An example valid declaration is \token{<?xml
version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>}.  (References: L2V2
Section~4.1; L2V3 Section~\ref{sec:sbml}.)
