If an \Event's \token{useValuesFromTriggerTime} attribute has the value
\val{false}, then the \Event must contain a \Delay element.  The necessary
implication of \token{useValuesFromTriggerTime}=\val{false} is precisely
that there is a delay between the time of trigger and the time of value
assignments performed by the \Event.  (References: L2V4
Section~\ref{sec:events}.)
