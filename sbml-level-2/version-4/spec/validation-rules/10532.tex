When the \token{variable} in a \RateRule definition refers to a \Species,
the units of the rule's right-hand side \changed{should} be of the form \emph{x per
time}, where \emph{x} is the units of that species' quantity, and
\emph{time} refers to the units of time for the model.  (References: L2V2
Section~4.11.4; L2V3 Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
