When the \token{variable} in a \RateRule definition refers to a
\Compartment, the units of the rule's right-hand side \changed{should} be of the form
\emph{x per time}, where \emph{x} is either the \token{units} in that
\Compartment definition, or (in the absence of explicit units declared for
the compartment size) the default units for that compartment, and
\emph{time} refers to the units of time for the model.  (References: L2V2
Section~4.11.4; L2V3 Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
