The value of the \token{id} attribute on every instance of the
following classes of objects in a model must be unique
across the set of all \token{id} values in a model: \Model,
\FunctionDefinition, \CompartmentType, \SpeciesType,
\Compartment, \Species, \Reaction, \SpeciesReference,
\ModifierSpeciesReference, \Event, and model-wide \Parameter{}s.
Exception: the identifiers of instances of \UnitDefinition, and parameters defined
inside a reaction, are treated separately.  (References: L2V1
