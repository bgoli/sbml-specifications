The value of the \token{kind} attribute of a \Unit can only be
one of the predefined base units in SBML; that is, the SBML unit
system is not hierarchical and user-defined units cannot be defined using
other user-defined units.  (References: L2V2 Section~4.4.1;
L2V3 Section~\ref{sec:unit-structure}.)
