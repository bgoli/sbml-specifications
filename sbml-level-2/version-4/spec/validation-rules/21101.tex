A \Reaction definition must contain at least one \SpeciesReference, either
in its \token{listOfReactants} or its \token{listOfProducts}.  A reaction
without any reactant or product species is not permitted, regardless of
whether the reaction has any modifier species.  (References: L2V2
Section~4.13.1; L2V3 Section~4.13.3; L2V4 Section~\ref{subsec:speciesreference}.)
