(Rule does not apply in SBML \thisLV.)

% In SBML Level~2 prior to Version~3, a \Species definition must not set
% \token{spatialSizeUnits} if the \Compartment in which it is located has a
% \token{spatialDimensions} value of \val{0}.  (\token{spatialSizeUnits}
% has been removed in SBML \thisLV.  References: L2V1 Section
