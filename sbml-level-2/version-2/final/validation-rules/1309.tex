The \token{outside} field value of a \Compartment cannot be a compartment
whose \token{spatialDimensions} value is \val{0}, unless both compartments
have \token{spatialDimensions}=\val{0}.  Simply put, a zero-dimensional
compartment cannot enclose compartments that have anything other than zero
dimensions themselves.  (Reference: L2V2
Section~\ref{sec:compartment-outside}.)
