Redefinitions of the built-in unit \token{time} must be based on
\token{second}.  More formally, a \UnitDefinition for \token{time} must
simplify to a single \Unit in which either (a) the \token{kind} field has a
value of \val{second} and the \token{exponent} field has a value of
\val{1}, or (b) the \token{kind} field has a value of
\val{dimensionless} with any \token{exponent} value.  (References: L2V1
Section 4.4.3; L2V2 Section~\ref{sec:built-in-units}.)
