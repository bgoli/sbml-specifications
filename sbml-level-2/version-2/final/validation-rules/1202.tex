Redefinitions of the built-in unit \token{substance} must be based on the
units \token{mole} or \token{item}.  More formally, a \UnitDefinition for
\token{substance} must simplify to a single \Unit whose \token{kind} field
has a value of either \val{mole} or \val{item} and whose
\token{exponent} field has a value of \val{1}.  (References: L2V1 Section
4.4.3; L2V2 Section~\ref{sec:built-in-units}.)
