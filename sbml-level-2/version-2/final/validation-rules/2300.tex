An SBML XML file must use UTF-8 as the character encoding.  More
precisely, if the \token{encoding} attribute is supplied on the
XML declaration at the beginning of the XML data stream, it cannot
have a value other than \val{UTF-8}.  An example valid declaration
is \token{<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>}.  (References:
SBML L2V2 Section~\ref{sec:sbml}.)
