The units of the \token{math} formula in a \KineticLaw definition must be
the equivalent of \emph{substance per time}.  The optional \KineticLaw
fields \token{substanceUnits} and \token{timeUnits} determine the units of
substance and time, respectively.  In the absence of values for these, the
units are taken from the model's defaults.  (References: L2V2
Section~\ref{subsec:kinetic-law}.)
