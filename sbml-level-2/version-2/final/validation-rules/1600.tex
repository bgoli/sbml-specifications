A \Reaction definition must contain at least one \SpeciesReference, either
in its \token{listOfReactants} or its \token{listOfProducts}.  A reaction
without any reactant or product species is not permitted, regardless of
whether the reaction has any modifier species.  (References: L2V2
Section~\ref{subsec:speciesreference}.)
