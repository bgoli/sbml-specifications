When the \token{variable} in an \AssignmentRule refers to a \Compartment,
the units of the rule's right-hand side must be consistent with either the
\token{units} in that \Compartment definition, or (in the absence of
explicit units declared for the compartment size) the default units for
that compartment.  (References: L2V2 Section~\ref{sec:assignmentrule}.)
