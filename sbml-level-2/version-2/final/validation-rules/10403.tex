Redefinitions of the built-in unit \token{length} must be based on the unit
\token{metre} or \token{dimensionless}.  More formally, a \UnitDefinition
for \token{length} must simplify to a single \Unit in which either (a) the
\token{kind} field has a value of \val{metre} and the \token{exponent}
field has a value of \val{1}, or (b) the \token{kind} field has a value
of \val{dimensionless} with any \token{exponent} value.  (References:
L2V1 Section 4.4.3; L2V2 Section~\ref{sec:built-in-units}.)
