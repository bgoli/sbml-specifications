When the \token{variable} in a \RateRule definition refers to a \Species,
the units of the rule's right-hand side must be of the form \emph{x per
time}, where \emph{x} is either the \token{units} in that \Species
definition, or (in the absence of explicit units declared for the species'
quantity) the default units for that species, and \emph{time} refers to the
units of time for the model.  (References: L2V2
Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
