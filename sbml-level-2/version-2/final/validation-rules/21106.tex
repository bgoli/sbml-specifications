The \token{substanceUnits} field on \Reaction, previously
available in SBML Level~1 and Level~2 Version~1, has been removed
as of SBML Level~2 Version~2.  In SBML Level~2 Version~2, the
substance units of a reaction rate expression are those of the
global \val{substance} units of the model.  (References: L2V2
Section~\ref{subsec:kinetic-law}.)
