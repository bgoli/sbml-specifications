Unless a species is a boundary species in a model, its concentration or
amount cannot be set by both reactions and rules simultaneously.  More
formally, if the identifier of a \Species definition having a
\token{boundaryCondition} value of \val{false} is referenced by a
\SpeciesReference anywhere in a model, then this identifier cannot also
appear as the value of a \token{variable} in an \AssignmentRule or a
\RateRule definition.  (References: implicit in L2V1 Section 4.6.5; L2V2
Section~\ref{sec:species-constant}.)
