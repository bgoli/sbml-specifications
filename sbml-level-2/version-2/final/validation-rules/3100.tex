When the \token{variable} in a \RateRule definition refers to a
\Compartment, the units of the rule's right-hand side must be of the form
\emph{x per time}, where \emph{x} is either the \token{units} in that
\Compartment definition, or (in the absence of explicit units declared for
the compartment size) the default units for that compartment, and 'time'
refers to the units of time for the model.  (References: L2V2
Section~\ref{sec:raterule}.)
