There cannot be more than one species of a given \SpeciesType in the same
compartment of a model.  More formally, for any given compartment, there
cannot be more than one \Species definition in which both of the following
hold simultaneously: (i) the \Species' \token{compartment} value is set to
that compartment's identifier and (ii) the \Species' \token{speciesType} is
set the same value as the \token{speciesType} of another \Species that also
sets its \token{compartment} to that compartment identifier.  (References:
L2V2 Section~\ref{sec:species-species-type}.)
