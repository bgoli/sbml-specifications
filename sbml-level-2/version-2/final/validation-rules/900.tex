The value of the \token{id} field on every instance of the
following in a model must be unique: \Model, \FunctionDefinition,
\CompartmentType, \Compartment, \SpeciesType, \Species, \Reaction,
\SpeciesReference, \ModifierSpeciesReference, \Event, and
model-wide \Parameter{}s.  Note that \UnitDefinition and
parameters defined inside a reaction are treated separately.
