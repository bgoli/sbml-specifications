When the \token{variable} in an \InitialAssignment refers to a \Species,
the units of the \InitialAssignment's \token{math} expression must be
consistent with either the \token{units} in that \Species definition, or
(in the absence of explicit units declared for the species' quantity) the
default units for that species.  (References: L2V2
Section~\ref{sec:assignmentrule}.)
