The identifier given as the value of a \token{symbol}
attribute in any \InitialAssignment definition cannot also appear
as the value of the \token{variable} attribute in an
\AssignmentRule.  In other words, a model cannot
simultaneously define both an initial assignment and an assignment rule for
the same species, compartment or parameter in a model.
