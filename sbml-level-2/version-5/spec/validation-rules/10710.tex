The value of the \token{sboTerm} attribute on an \Event should be
an SBO identifier referring to a interaction framework.  That is, the
value should be a term derived from \sbointeractionID,
``occurring entity representation''.  (References: L2V2 Section~4.14.1; L2V3
Section~4.14.1; L2V4 Section~4.14.1; L2V5 Section~\ref{sec:event-sboterm}.)
