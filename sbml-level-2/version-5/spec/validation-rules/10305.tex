In each \Event, the value of the \token{variable} attribute
within every \EventAssignment definition must be unique across the set of
all \EventAssignment{}s within that \Event.  In other words, a
single \Event cannot make more than one assignment to a given
identifier.  (References: L2V1 erratum~17; L2V2 Section~4.14.2;
