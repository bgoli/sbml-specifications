The value of the \token{sboTerm} attribute on a \Reaction should
be an SBO identifier referring to an interaction framework.  That
is, the value should be a term derived from \sbointeractionID,
``\changed{occurring entity representation}''.  (References: L2V2 Section~4.13.1; L2V3
Section~4.13.1; L2V4 Section~4.13.1\changed{; L2V5 Section~\ref{sec:reaction-sboterm}}.)
