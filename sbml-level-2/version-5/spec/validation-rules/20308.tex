Inside the \token{lambda} MathML element within a \FunctionDefinition object, mutually recursive functions are not allowed.  \FunctionDefinition \token{id} attributes may not appear as identifiers in \token{lambda} MathML elements if that appearance would cause a self-referential loop of function definitions.  (References: SBML L2V5 Section~\ref{sec:functiondefinition}.)
