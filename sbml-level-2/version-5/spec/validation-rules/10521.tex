When the \token{variable} in an \InitialAssignment refers to a
\Compartment, the units of the \InitialAssignment's \token{math} expression
should be consistent with the units of that compartment's size.  (References:
L2V2 Section~4.10.4; L2V3 Section~4.10; L2V4 Section~4.10; \changed{L2V5 Section~\ref{sec:initialAssignment}}.)
