If a model defines any \Species, then the model must also define at least
one \Compartment.  This is an implication of the fact that the
\token{compartment} attribute on \Species is not optional.  (References: L2V1
Section~4.5; L2V2 Section~4.8.3; L2V3 Section~4.8.3; L2V4 Section~4.8.3; L2V5 Section~\ref{sec:species-compartment}.)
